N Hassan's Citadel~
Ref 0
D
Tall walls of thick granite mark the rim of the Citadel Tower high on
Mount Hirash in the northern Andraius range.  The view is spectacular, the
peak of the mountain fortress is the highest in this region, and you can see
for miles around.  To the southeast, beyond the foothills, is the Kaerbrok
river valley where you can see the city of Kess and the plains, stretching
southward, beyond your field of view.  To the north is a high parapet where
visitors can watch the beaches of the Great Ocean, and, in the distance, a
dark smudge is all that can be seen of Tyselorrd, land of the tyrants.  Soft
waves crash into rocks, the tips of which are visible in the light.  To the
southwest are another set of plains, here lies the small villages of Keveg
and Vesper, and ports south along the western shores of the Isle.  Directly
south you can see a pass through the mountains.
