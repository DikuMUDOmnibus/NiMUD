left out to ferment to the next batch.  It has a hard, flaky crust, with a
soft inside.

As you gnaw on the hard tack, you wonder how anyone could find this even slightly filling or nutritional.

PD
%s pieces of tack bread lie here
~
DR
The hard piece of tack bread looks stale and unappetizing at best.
Sand and old water and salt seem the most likely ingredients.
You wonder how anyone but a half-starved vagabond could eat it without emptying their stomach.

N The Workshop~

A great deal of unfinished projects lie around the workshop.  There are
half-men sitting in disrepair in one corner, a river flows along a workbench
where it stops, suddenly, having been neglected by a careless deity.  There
are tools of all sorts lying about in disarray.  A metal gangway leads down.

You are situated on a cold, steel floor with wide columns reaching high
above your head.  The room is relatively dark and very clammy, with an odd
smell that pervades your nostrils.  You smell strange chemicals in the air
and perceive odd noises coming from all sides, always seemingly from just
beyond your vision.  A metal gangway leads up from here.
