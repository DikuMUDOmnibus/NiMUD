SD Denambren's consort~
LD
 A curvaceous beauty stands here, a playful smile on her lips.
~
D
 This woman stands a little under twelve handspans tall, her curvaceous
body accentuating every handspan that your eyes lay their sights on.  She
carries herself with a confident grace which can be seen reflected within
her dark, brown eyes, their long lashes beating softly as she gazes about
the area.  Her skin is deeply-tanned, and a lush cascade of raven hair
washes down her shoulders and stops at her waist.  Almost a sculpture of
beauty itself, you realize that no such woman could exist without the divine
intervention of the gods themselves.

hi Locke.  sorry i haven't been around as much lately, school's taking
up a lot of time.  i got that 'arts and clothes in medeval times' book
i was talking about but it turned out to be a skinny little childrens book
with nothing helpful in it at all, so i have to go look for another one.
i wrote a piece for the site if you want it, haven't put it on computer yet.
i'll try and write more soon.  bye

N Perrin's laboratory~
Ref 0

A small, oddly shaped room with a smell of neglect, the laboratory obviously
has not been cleaned for a while, and the strange smells coming from a table
to the right of the door do not help the atmosphere.  Looking at the table
shows you dozens of little vials filled with strangely colored liquids.

In the far right corner is a wooden framed bed, and across from it is a
big-screen tv with surround sound.  Next to the bed is a desk with a
computer on it and a large 100 disc stereo.  Just to the right of the door
you see a grand piano, with sheet music scattered all over it.  
Dark-green carpeting lines the floor, and graffiti covers the walls.  You 
wish you had a bedroom as cool as Perrin's.
