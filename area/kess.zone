 You see a raven-haired man of average height before you; a man comfortable
enough with his place and environment to have a relaxed stance and an
easy-going, tenor timbre to his voice.  He is not thin, nor is he particularly
bulky, although he has a thick sinew to his arms-- a wiry strength.  His
hands are more delicate than you might expect them to be; they certainly have
few callouses to them, and they are well-manicured.

 Fiery auburn hair flies out in most directions, framing this short, pale
woman's face, and she moves with a grace that seems as natural as flowing
water.  Her well-calloused hands are often fidgeting, as if she were not at all used to them being idle.  Her voice is a melodic mezzosoprano, and
although it is soft, it has a steady power to it.  She stares at
something constantly, and shifts her gaze infrequently.  Regardless of what
she is studying, however, the look she gives it is the same-- an intense,
emerald-eyed stare, as if she were trying to reach the core of her target.

Notes on this Timeline

    Calenders throughout the realms on Tyselorrd have changed dramatically
    over the centuries.  In addition to the standard calenders of each age,
    many kingdoms had adopted their own timekeeping system.  For the
    modern reader, we have simplified the timeline as much as possible
    while still retaining the original dates of each individual kingdom
    or age which is the focus of that particular passage of the timeline.
    The number in the far left column contains the date in relation to the
    first entry in the timeline.  The number in the next column to its
    right is the local date, followed by the passage.

                                  Four other kingdoms exist in the realm,
                                  newly founded from manors of now forgotten
                                  lords.  They are Northalg, Savet and
                                  Soudbrun.  Vlattensintri's yet unnamed
                                  citadel is stocked for the winter just in
                                  time.  The King is set to arrive the
                                  following year.

     2   2 of Vlattensintri     - Upon the arrival of the King in early spring

                                  thus is named the grand citadel Tallez, and
                                  the city the same.

        From the Author

        This text is written solely for the purpose of outline and explaining
    the different aspects of the Tyselorrd game, specifically the parts of
    the world which are important to playing on The Isles MUD.  The ideas
    contained herein are solely owned by the author, Herb Gilliland.  He
    reserves the right to modify, omit or remove any of this at any time.
        Aladro's Island Almanac is written in the first person to make it
    entertaining as well as informative.  Aladro's persona is defined in
    the 'From Aladro' section of this introduction.

        From Aladro
        
        This would be my first written log of events and information
    ever published by my own hand.  For years I've studied the oldest
    tomes in the lycaeum here in Kess, but I've never taken to writing
    well, and this has taken me much effort to produce.
        I grew up in the city, in the service of my lord Coranos Rygor,
    and his father Ikthius Rygor.  I am an old man, having lived for the
    length of two kings, and I know a bit of lore has passed before mine
    eyes plenty of times.
        This compilation contains my notes to the newcomer.  I have read
    of many lands far and wide across our great oceans, and this text is
    offered unto the traveler; use it well, for it shall familiarize you
    with the parts of these islands that, for natives, are like second
    nature to us.
    


------------------------[    Unitary Systems    ]--------------------------

 - [Monetary Units] 
 
        Each kingdom, it seems, has had its own currency.  The Rygor
        line has standardized the money system throughout these islands,
        much to the appreciation of the merchant class.  I have ranked
        the coins according to the currency value (c's).
        
 10000c Bezain are coins made from precious metal alloys, usually platinum
        and gold, though sometimes gold and silver (commonly known as
        electrum).  Each bezain is one-half halfspan across and as thick
        as a thumbnail. A bezain is worth one ten thousand units of currency.
        
  1000c Platinum coins are hand-pressed coins with a diameter equal to a
        dwarf's smallest finger, or about one third handspan (see below).
        Each platinum piece is worth one thousand units of currency.
        
   100c Gold pieces, rich man's tokens, are smaller than platinum coins,
        but thicker, to even out their weight with platinum pieces.  They
        are stamped with the visage of the current king, in this case,
        Coranos Rygor.  A gold piece is worth one hundred units of currency.
        
    10c Silver coins rank as ten currency units.  They are the same size and
        thickness as gold coins.
        
     1c Copper pieces, the most common coins, are standard sized coins that
        rank the same size and thickness as gold and silver coins.  Each
        copper is equal to one currency unit.
        
 - [Weight, Length and Volume]
 
        The standard units of measurement across the Isles and on the
        mainland of Tyselorrd are as follows.
 
        Weight:       (english equivalent)
        
          halfstone             1/2 pound
          stone                 1 pound
          dustone               2 pounds
          
        Metals:
        
          halfbar               1/2 bar
          bar                   1 handspan by 1 halfspan by 2 qetspans
          durbar                2 bars worth
          
        Lengths:
        
          qetspan               1 inch
          halfspan              3 inches
          handspan              6 inches
          duspan               12 inches
          
        Volume (solid):
        
          halfskal              3 cubic inches
          handskal              6 cubic inches
          duskal               12 cubic inches
          
          halfbral            1/2 brals   (50 duskals)
          bral                100 duskals
          dubral                2 brals   (200 duskals)

        Volume (liquid):
        
          halfswil              1 cup
          handswil              1 pint
          duswil                1 quart
          
          halfcask              1/2 cask (2 duswils)
          undcask               4 duswils
          ducask                2 casks  (8 duswils)
          
 - [Time]
 
        Time on the isles is seperated into years, months, weeks, days,
        hours and, for those with clockwork timepieces, minutes and seconds.

             The days are as follows: Great Hawk (Lexo), Falcon (Franto),

What lies before you in the following moments is an excerpt from
    several works-in-progress which help to lay out an epic tale that
    takes place in the fictional world called Tyselorrd, land of
    the Tyrants.  It is a work of fantastic fiction: that is, it is
    created completely in the mind of its author-- myself.
    
 
        The forgotten lore of the northland forests,
        Told of the great city-states of old,
        Now upon only the times of history rest,
        And those who would be so adventurous and bold;
        Could find these cities: Soudbrun, Cetvin, Tallez and Mordel,
        The ruinous spires of the forbidden cities,
        The ancient war-kings and their ancient citadel,
        Now shrouded more in mists than mysteries,
        Yet still one can find a tale to be told.
        
     I now begin the War Cant, a historical tale of the final battle
     between King Coranos Rygor of the Southern Isles of Jharl and
     the great dwarven empress Tiktui who rules all of Tyselorrd,
     the land of the Tyrants.  Tiktui had come to power by allying
     herself with the malignant city-state of Nostol and its haenous
     leader, King Haedar.  Slowly, her power grew to encompass the
     southlands of Tyselorrd and much of the southern mainland itself.
     Eventually, Tiktui was able to capture the city Kyrinn -- the
     largest city in the known world and the seat of great power.
        With the beseigement of Kyrinn, Tiktui now had control over
     what was known as the Gemmaster's Guild -- a group of supernatural
     magicians who were able to wield enormous natural energies that
     could coelesce into numerous forms of both healing and destruction.
     With this, Tiktui would seem unstoppable.  In fact, all but the
     Southern Isles had sworn allegance to her in fear of her wrath.     
       It is through the revealment of two ancient artifacts (the Crown
     of the Zengalli and the Sword of Vlattensintri) that gives King Rygor
     the power to overthrow the tyranness Tiktui and her hosts of undead
     soldiers.  The Crown is uncovered by an enigmatic race of forest-
     dwelling mystics, called Thilonenne, while the Sword is found and
     brought before the King by a curious young squire searching in the
     ruins of an ancient underground catacomb.
     
     The War Cant is thus:
 
 
        Epic battles pressing kings,
        War-horns blowing warnings,
        Yet the darkling hour has yet to come,
        For they have sought twice then thrice the chosen one.
        
        Ere the dwarven mistress, now empress,
        Sitting on her throne of bone,
        In the northlands of the Tyrants,
        She waits now with armies of her own.
        
        The enigma of the thilons,
        South they live in forests deep,
        They've moved northward to the King,
        And parleyed for his wonderous Keep.
        
        The One race, so they seem,
        Ancient mysteries left unsought,
        These the thilonenne have awakened,
        From the iron of ancient kings:
        They found the Crown that was wrought.
        
        First only the sound of horn,
        Now the war banners are unfurled,
        Marching south the undead wrath forsaken,
        Rygor's judgement fates the world.
        
        The squire found in forgotten chambers,
        The sword of Vlattensintri concealed,
        Before the King the squire came,
        And to him the sword now revealed.
        
        Yea the monsters would perish on fields,
        And in Kltara all would bear arms,
        The King himself thrice as strong,
        Come forth to protect his peasants' farms.
        
        Drawing quick from ancient splendors,
        Tiktui now had nothing to boast,
        Living gods of Valor ventured,
        Northward fleets would seek Her hosts.
        
        To the Elder Days once taken,
        Jharl revealed as more than a few,
        The coming told now of the new tribes,
        And the revival brought Zengalli anew.
        
        So it would be the greatest epoch,
        The ancient humans now resurrected,
        Coming forth to challenge the tyrant,
        The Leader, the Chosen, the Host of the War-Cant.

          In the earliest reaches of modern history on and about
      the continent of Tyselorrd, there were three great periods of
      history.  These episodes were:  The Great Uniting and Exodus,
      The Rise of the Guild and the Wrath of Tiktui.  
      
         The Great Uniting (1-52)
         
      Out of the great midcontinental basin, to the northwest of
      the Ring of Fire on the mainland, three tribes vied for power
      amongst the masses of human civilization.  The most powerful
      of the tribal leaders was Vlattensintri, the great warrior
      king who conquered the northlands along the rivers Tallez and
      Fodbrok, and later settled areas encompassing much of the
      northlands.
          A team of colonists travel southward to explore and settle
      an area south of the Ring of Fire.  Seperate from the great
      empire is the town of Nostol, on the southern shores.
          In the midst of Vlattensintri's glorious reign, a rival
      tribe by bloodmark, called the Zengalli, arose from the basin
      to oppose Vlattensintri.  The Zengalli are weak and unable
      to greatly threaten Vlattensintri's stranglehold on his kingdom.
      The great citadel at Tallez remains in the hands of its creator,
      Vlattensintri.
          Vlattensintri weds Maesha and his heir, Vlan, is born.
      Maesha dies in childbirth.  Later, Vlattensintri takes his
      second wife, Vassentra, and to them are born two daughters, 
      Iret and Nemi.
      
         The Exodus (52-211)

          After Overlord Vlattensintri's death, Vlan seizes control
      of the kingdom.  Mismanagement and greed cause the greater
      downfall of Vlattensintri's reign.  In the end, Vlan is overthrown
      by his rival sisters efforts with a revolutionary group called
      the Pi'chek-Ur.  The Pi'chek-Ur dissolve into the armies of the
      coastal kingdom, the Iak-paro, longtime allies with Vlattensintri.
      In its weakened state, the empire wrought by Vlattensintri begins
      to crumble and is eventually conceded by the Zengalli.  At this
      time a great Crown is wrought by a mysterious race called the
      Alvak, a mysterious people who keep temples in the Ring of Fire.
      The favored sword of the dead King Vlattensintri is also reforged
      here at this time.  The Alvak, after seeing the uniting of the
      human tribes by the Zengalli, take the Crown and the Sword and
      disappear across the Watervoid.

          The Rise of the Guild (211-1109)

          The Iak-paro eventually fades with time and the Zengalli declare
      control of the northlands.  The Zengalli are a proud and noble
      race now-- their blood has mixed with the crafty Iak-paro and the
      valorous and hardy Vlattensintri.  They rediscover the southern
      city of Nostol and its neighboring dwarven city, Hransoerd.  This
      is the first real contact with dwarves.  Hransoerd is a great
      mining establishment south of the Ring of Fire that yeilds great
      ore supplies.  Great ties are founded between the Hransoerd dwarves
      and the people of Nostol, and thus these ties move to the Zengalli.
          The Hransoerd dwarves reveal a great cache of mysterious gems
      with strange inate properties.  The great philosopher, Kyrinnus,
      founds a small enclave to the west of Nostol called Kyrinn, dedicated
      to the study of the nature of these gems.  Upon his death his closest
      students formed a guild dedicated to the proper use of these elemental
      crystals, called the Welkyn, the Gemmaster's Guild.  Kyrinn's 
      population grew at an alarming rate.  It soon became larger than
      the northern cities and was a great southern seaport.
          A great age of exploration begins.  Many ships sail in all
      directions to discover what lies outward upon the oceans of Watervoid
      and the Great Ocean.  Many never return.  To the south, a great
      archipelago is discovered by the human explorer Jharl of Kyrinn.
      A few small settlements appear on the northern coast as refueling
      depots for southward-bound expeditions.  Eventually a great port on
      the southwestern side of the island, south of what is referred to as
      the Broken Coast, is established.  Due to the color of the sands along
      the cape which it flanks, the town is called the Port of Cape Red.
          The thilonenne are discovered inland on Rygor Isle, and later
      more are discovered to the south on the island of Mudak.  These
      thilonenne, strikingly similar to the Alvak, live in stone structures
      in the deep forests of Cape Red.  They coexist with a primitive
      tribal people called the drev.

        From the Author

        This text is written solely for the purpose of outline and explaining
    the different aspects of the Tyselorrd game, specifically the parts of
    the world which are important to playing on The Isles MUD.  The ideas
    contained herein are solely owned by the author, Herb Gilliland.  He
    reserves the right to modify, omit or remove any of this at any time.
        Aladro's Island Almanac is written in the first person to make it
    entertaining as well as informative.  Aladro's persona is defined in
    the 'From Aladro' section of this introduction.

        From Aladro
        
        This would be my first written log of events and information
    ever published by my own hand.  For years I've studied the oldest
    tomes in the lycaeum here in Kess, but I've never taken to writing
    well, and this has taken me much effort to produce.
        I grew up in the city, in the service of my lord Coranos Rygor,
    and his father Ikthius Rygor.  I am an old man, having lived for the
    length of two kings, and I know a bit of lore has passed before mine
    eyes plenty of times.
        This compilation contains my notes to the newcomer.  I have read
    of many lands far and wide across our great oceans, and this text is
    offered unto the traveler; use it well, for it shall familiarize you
    with the parts of these islands that, for natives, are like second
    nature to us.
    


------------------------[    Unitary Systems    ]--------------------------

 - [Monetary Units] 
 
        Each kingdom, it seems, has had its own currency.  The Rygor
        line has standardized the money system throughout these islands,
        much to the appreciation of the merchant class.  I have ranked
        the coins according to the currency value (c's).
        
 10000c Bezain are coins made from precious metal alloys, usually platinum
        and gold, though sometimes gold and silver (commonly known as
        electrum).  Each bezain is one-half halfspan across and as thick
        as a thumbnail. A bezain is worth one ten thousand units of currency.
        
  1000c Platinum coins are hand-pressed coins with a diameter equal to a
        dwarf's smallest finger, or about one third handspan (see below).
        Each platinum piece is worth one thousand units of currency.
        
   100c Gold pieces, rich man's tokens, are smaller than platinum coins,
        but thicker, to even out their weight with platinum pieces.  They
        are stamped with the visage of the current king, in this case,
        Coranos Rygor.  A gold piece is worth one hundred units of currency.
        
    10c Silver coins rank as ten currency units.  They are the same size and
        thickness as gold coins.
        
     1c Copper pieces, the most common coins, are standard sized coins that
        rank the same size and thickness as gold and silver coins.  Each
        copper is equal to one currency unit.
        
 - [Weight, Length and Volume]
 
        The standard units of measurement across the Isles and on the
        mainland of Tyselorrd are as follows.
 
        Weight:       (english equivalent)
        
          halfstone             1/2 pound
          stone                 1 pound
          dustone               2 pounds
          
        Metals:
        
          halfbar               1/2 bar
          bar                   1 handspan by 1 halfspan by 2 qetspans
          durbar                2 bars worth

You see before you a lengthy chain of thin silver links.  Although the links
are tiny, they do not at all seem delicate or fragile.  An unusually large
pendant-- a chunk of steel-- hangs from the chain; it is a wolf's head, with
tiny and detailed feathers hanging from it.  The feathers are large and
grooved, and they all seem to move as one unit.

structures, in fact, are owned by farmers from the countryside who need a
place to stay during the harvest season, and have found housing cheaper than
repetative stays at an Inn or other nightly establishment.  West is

You are inside the Kessian library, a tall vaulted structure located at
the end of Carthage Road.  Recently build by the King's coffers, the library
has many books in it which describe various aspects of the world, written of
course and then copied by the monks in Kyrinn, imported via ship and set
here by the librarians.  King Rygor is happy to have offered such a great
opportunity to his people despite the growing conflict in the north and his
need for more soldiers, the King wants his people to be happy and educated
and literate so they may be better citizens.

This building appears much smaller on the inside than it did from the
street; the low ceiling and abundance of racks and shelves seem to
accentuate that fact.  The racks and shelves used seem sturdy enough, but
they are entirely plain-- completely without embellishment or polish.  The
store lighting is dim as well, with very few lamps and candles putting out
barely enough light to read by.  The wares for sale, however, are anything
but plain.  Although there are quite a few unadorned weapons, even they are
of the utmost quality, forged from fine materials.

Lit by a few tall tapers and the glow of the fireplace, the inside of
Renatt Pub has a dark but warm feel to it.  The walls are wood paneling for
the first few duspans, and a dark taupe beyond that, all the way up to the
high paneled ceiling.  The rafters are bare, old darkwood, which lend the
structure an air of stability.  What little light there is in this pub tends
to focus around two main areas-- the bar itself, a long shiny-topped slab of
oak with numerous stools surrounding it, and the fireplace, a rough stone
structure that always seems to have a roaring fire in it.  The bar smells of
porter, smoke and cedar; the air is thick, but breathable.

To the southwest lies a narrow cobbled road that appears to be split down
the middle by some short, jagged structure.  To the east, very few of the
buildings sport any signs or banners-- there are almost no external indications of what the buildings do.  The quality of the structures is still reasonably
comparable to the remainder of the concourse buildings, but there are
more scratches and gouges in their facades, and more chips in the glass
and on the door frames.

Some structures have no wall facing the street-- they are merely three walls

is unpaved, and deep grooves have been carved into the dirt road.  The
buildings are filthy and stink of overuse, but they are stable enough
structures-- reasonable shelter in a storm.

Huge, pentagonal slate-gray stones pave this short, wide road.  In the
distance to the north, you see the slight curvature and massive span of 
the Great Stone Bridge.  Every so often, the stones to the far east and
west of the road are carved; they seem to have various coats of arms and
sigils of past rulers and foreign dignitaries.  Small trees line the sides
of the road at even intervals; apparently these are new additions to this
stately, but short, thoroughfare.

You are on a wide street, which is paved with rough-cut gray stones of
remarkable cleanliness.  Street lamps are sparse, but larger than usual,
and they appear to provide a fair bit of light to the road.  Large, blocky
buildings line the street; although they are not at all ornamented, they
appear to be reasonably old.  Very few of the structures are short-- most
are two or three stories tall-- and almost none of them have any windows
facing the street on the first level.

This street, although quite obviously paved to be a real avenue, is 
scarcely wider than most of the spindly alleys that weave their way
through the whole of Kess-- and a number of those alleys can boast more
traffic.  Although the street appears clean enough, it is desolate most
of the time.  A few shops sport signs, but the indicators are weathered
and faded with age, seemingly put up as an afterthought.  The city wall that
enshrouds this narrow road in shadow most of the day is as old as the 
street itself, and elaborately carved with scrollwork and patterns that have
not been in common use in centuries.

A short wall, jagged and broken with crumbling rocks runs down the center

which fell long ago, in the Siege of '32.  The street built around the old
monument is crowded and narrow, packed tightly with two-story structures
which are thin and old buildings with spire-like rooves.  These structures
are quite varied, despite their similar age and shape-- they appear to be a
liberal mixture of houses and shops, with guild insignias carved or painted
upon quite a few doors as well.

buildings-- the detailing along the rooves and doorways are older patterns,
rarely used in construction these days.  All of the buildings, though in good
repair, seem to have a faded countenance, as though they wished to show off 
their age.  The pigments of stone and wood are sedate and dark, very stately
colors.  You can still hear the bustle of the bazaar from the plaza, to the 
east, although this road has plenty of traffic on its own.

lush gardens, fragrant and flowering at any time of year.  The gardens
are manicured, but not to extremes-- there are places where a tree or ivy
has been allowed to flow over its surroundings like a free-flowing creek.
Here and there along the Road there are urns the size of a large well, filled
with plants of varying sizes and shapes.  Although the road never seems
to be overly crowded, there are usually a few people scattered around its
path, examining a plant or just wandering around.

they all house shops of one sort or another.  Signs adorn the outside of just
about every store, either painted on the window or carved into the door, or

curious.  Even the lamp posts along this wide avenue are of many different
makes, so it is no small wonder that the buildings are even more varied and
unusual.  The pigments used in some of the storefronts are exotic enough to
be expensive for use in small scarves and garments, let alone whole doors

by no means plain; they all have the subtle feel of extreme quality. Although
a bit of scrollwork and detail is seen on practically every housefront,
the feeling goes deeper than that-- to the cut of the stone, or the pigment

To the east and west is a loop of Soothsayer, surrounding the Swodsrud to

laid stones -- it is an expanse of blackened, compact soot and gravel
between the various smithys and bowyers and like shops.  This is where the
implements of the Royal army are forged -- the finest weaponsmiths in Kess
have resided here since the beginnings of the Kessian Expansion, though now
the square is cramped between roads and residences that were not here during
its creation.

N Intersection Of Truncot And Soothsayer~

The uniform gray stones of Truncot end in a row of double-sized, rougher
cobbles and two large iron lampposts.  Little by little the gray of the
wide road fades, as it turns into a smaller, but not insubstantial 
north-south roadway of mottled and varied stones.  The row of businesses
along the western side of this road are all in tall, well-ornamented

street banners and grand painted signs.  The narrower road, Soothsayer, is
just as buzzing as Truncot, with merchant wagons and passersby no matter what

N Soothsayer Square~
Ref 0
D
The stones beneath you vary in color and origin, but all of them have the
same worn, oft-used feel to them.  Holding patterns within patterns, the
grey and brown cobbles spiral out from the center of the square.  Upon a
careful consideration, you may notice that certain stones bear -carvings upon
their faces, although most of the carvings are faint, given the wear on the
stones.  All of the stores surrounding the square have an old feel to them,
and the craftsmanship of the buildings is beyond compare.  Fine woodcarvings
adorn a number of the window shutters and door frames.

The colorful cobblestones end here, in a row of deep blue stones carves

richly lacquered darkwood continues, in the form of a small series of
docks.  Most of the boats berthed here are moderate-sized merchant ships,
but no matter what the size and designation of the vessel, they are all
well-made and well-apportioned.
