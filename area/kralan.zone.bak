Worship of the local townsfolk is a unique cultural experience in the

the King, and watched by outsiders as the positivity of the Dumandran
followers is known to resound in hill and vale throughout the island.  
The temple is modest, made of stone, ornamented with only a few brass
sepulchers, candlelabras and the like; the floor is covered in hay,
and stained glass windows peer to the outside.
