A huge stone wall many times the height of a giant stands fast against
the dilapidated depths of Soudkyr.  The stones are massive, quarried from
new rock in the southwestern basalt quarries in the Ring of Fire.  The base
stones of the basalt wall are obsidian, dotted here and there with bricks of
black onyx that gleam as though wet under moon and starlight.

You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but from where the
light comes, is a mystery.  The walls seem to radiate warmth and give the
pleasant feeling of being welcome here.  A large ^Bportrait^N is hanging on
one of the walls.  A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.  To the
east there is a high passage away from the hall.  This ends shortly after by
a tall oak door.  The enormous hall extends further north from here.  To the
south you can see a huge, and heavy wrought-iron door.  It looks like this
is the only exit from this magnificent enclosed city.  To the west you can
see a large ashen door.

in the dimly lit north-western corner of the room.  Two large and
well-crafted ^Bstatues^N adorn the center of the library together with a

ED midgaard town city~
You see a small speck with woods on the west from it, plains to the east
from it and mountains to the north from it. To the south from it you can
see a thin trail lead to a large castle. Finally you notice a rather large
river pour in from the east and go through Midgaard in the middle.

These windows are really BIG! They reach from about 20 inches above the
floor to approximately 10 inches under the ceiling. If you try and

The clouds muster and form the ground on which this entire building is set.
Through the thinnest of the clouds you can just make out MIDGAARD with all
