This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here that says:

	BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON

Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky looks
funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
intermittently in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-looking
river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to another
overlook.

magical water indeed.  Though you splash through the bay you do not get wet.

This chamber was magically created here on the floor of the bay.  It looks
like it's been here for a long, long time.  Though you are 'under water' there
is no difficulty breathing normally, and oddly you do not feel the pressure of
the water above you.

Last you knew, you were walking on the mesa.  Abruptly the path dropped
from beneath your feet much to quick for you to recover.  Instead of
plunging to your death, you seemingly miss the ground and begin walking
on air.  The space to the north and east seems just thin air, but you can
walk there.  The pathway you came from is to the south.
