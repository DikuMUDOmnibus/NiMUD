N North entrance to the catacombs~
Ref 0
D
You are almost surprised to see a tunnel leading off to the south
into utter darkness.  The floorboards above you haven't been moved
in a long time, yet there is life down here.  A beam of light from
the opening above you falls upon a message scrawled on the wall here.

The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed

An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.

the south streams darkness.  A message has been scrawled upon the wall
here.  The message reads:
     Adventure for the strong yet calculating
     Death for the weak and shallow
     Treasure for the smart and lucky
     Death for the stupid and accursed
An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
from the catacombs.

Oh dear you seem to have lost your way.  You look back from whence you
came but there's no exit there anymore.  There are exits in other
directions but you have a feeling that you are hopelessly lost.
