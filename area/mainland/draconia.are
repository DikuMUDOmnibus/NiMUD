N The top of the mountain~
Ref 0
D
You are standing at the top of the mountain.  It feels more like the top of
the world.  To your north lies a huge platinum door.  You hear very pronounced
grumbling from behind the doors.  It sounds like something huge and hungry.
But if you don't have the key you don't have to worry because you can't get it.
If you do have the key I would suggest not going in.  Some believe the Five
Headed dragon Tiamat was imprisoned here by the gods.  But who believes in 
fairy tales.  Well, if you're scared, you can always go down the mountain.

   I warned you!  You have fallen into the bottomless pit.  You life flashes
right before your eyes.  Pretty pathetic isn't it?  Next time you'll know
to listen to the God of Laughs.
