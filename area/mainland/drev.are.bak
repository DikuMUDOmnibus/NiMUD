N thilonenne wizard~
SD the Elven Wizard~
LD
 An Elven Wizard is here, creating fireworks for the festivities.
~
D
 The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems to
penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak
and holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older
than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
cannot overcome.

N ring keeper~
SD the Keeper of the Ring~
LD
 The Keeper of the Ring is here, guarding his treasure jealously.

D
 The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short drev.  His short stature and
bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An thilonenne sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
usually a drev of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
to take away that which belongs to him.

You feel your boots sinking into the mud.  Numerous pigs roam about,
oblivious to your company.  A grassy field is to the north while you see
a small path winding to the west.

N Gamgee Residence~
Ref 0
D
You stand inside a modest home.  You deduce that this is indeed the home
of whomever owns the surrounding lands.  The air is somewhat musty and 
the smell reminds you of a stable.  As you look around disdainfully, you
think to yourself that this is more of a shack than a proper residence and
you long for the urban riches of Drev city proper.

N A barn~
Ref 0
D
Animals of every sort fill the small barn.  You feel the hot breath of
horses and cows on your neck and you feel the sudden need for fresh air.
Other than that, you feel cozy and protected and don't mind staying for a
bit longer.  All the warmth and good vibes remind you of the days when your
mother would hold you in her arms and sing you to sleep.  You find yourself
wanting to cradle all the animals.

N The Green Dragon~
Ref 0
D
Welcome to the Green Dragon, the undisputed leader in the art of
innkeeping.  A rather charming and friendly hostess stands to the side,
ready to offer you food and drink.  While most of the patrons are drev
locals, you spy an occasional human or two.  As you listen more closely
to the conversations that fill the inn, you hear the tales of great and
seasoned adventurers as well as the usual gossip.  You feel as if you've
found your second home in the Green Dragon.  You see a stairway leading
upwards.
