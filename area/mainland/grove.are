ED mansion~
The mansion is a sprawling, two-story affair with three wings, where the top
of one wing serves as balcony. The walls look as marble would do, if marble
changed color slowly, continuously, through the entire spectrum. There are
large windows all over the house.

ED painting paintings~
They are strange indeed, works of breathtaking precision depicting obviously
impossible motifs, like a sky filled with headless men, all dressed in some
black costume (including hats), or a lady standing, blue from the waist up, or
some pieces of plankwood that seems to be melting away like snow, or a night
sky with a dove-shaped hole of bright day sky in the middle.

Through the windows next to the door you can see the croquet lawn, bathed in
afternoon sunlight.

Ref 0

You are in the blue room, one of the guest rooms in Dragon's mansion. The
walls are (surprise!) blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar
shades, producing a very nice, cool effect. There is a large bed and a
matching set of sofas, easy-chairs and a coffee table. Through the venetian
blinds in front of the large east window you can see the edge of the grove.

You are in the red room, one of the guest rooms in Dragon's mansion. The
walls are wallpapered a deep warm red, and dark mahogany panelling nicely com-
plements them. There is a large, warm waterbed and a sofa group in dark wood
with leather upholstery, including a coffee table. Heavy brown curtains are
pulled away from the wide windows, to reveal a nice view towards the grove.

N The kitchen~
Ref 0
D
You are standing in the middle of Dragon's kitchen. Contrary to popular
belief, He *doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large
variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

N The ballroom~
Ref 0
D
You are standing in the middle of a vast palisander floor. This is where
Dragon entertains large number of guests, but the cloth-covered chairs
standing forlornly in a corner suggests that this does not happen often.
There are doors in the south and west walls, while to the east there is a
short corridor to the greenhouse.

N The greenhouse~
Ref 0
D
This is Dragons' greenhouse. Green light filters in slantwise through the
plants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,
though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except 
the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
terrace.

ED painting paintings~
There are many, many beautiful paintings of famous dragons of history and
literature. There is a big one of Smaug, a group picture of Cuspidorian Toxic
Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of Norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-
and-white photograph of Vorgulremik the Steel Dragon, a romantic picture of 
Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, 
while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) 
fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great 
beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest 
portrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.

You are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the
west, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north
is the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful
colors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is
warm and calm here. There is a white-painted table with a parasol here,
together with a matched set of chairs.
