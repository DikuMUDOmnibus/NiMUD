ED sign~
The sign, which is really just a note taped to the device, reads:
"Press button one for coordinate X:L1-Ty439,
 Press button two for coordinate ORI-784 in geosyncronous orbit.
 Press button three for coordinate UC-384 in Upsilon Corvi.
 Press button four for coordinate KLS-20t/6 along time sequence 91:312:1955.
 Press button five for coordinate KLS-20t/6 along time sequence 91:312:1963.
 Press button six for coordinate ALR-197 station matrix 6."
 
Someone has scrawled "button 7 has not been tested !!!" at the bottom
of the note.
~
ED control panel~
A control panel marked with eight buttons, the first 7 of which have
numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and the final one is marked with an asterisk.
