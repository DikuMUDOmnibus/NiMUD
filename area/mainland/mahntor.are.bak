You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

N The swampy path~
Ref 0
D
You tread lightly in a wet, swampy path. All around you, you see pools of
quicksand and rotting vegetation. Unlike the forest to the west, the swamp is
teeming with life. Some of it is harmless, some is not. The path leads east
and west into more swamp.

N The swampy path~
Ref 0
D
You weave your way through the treacherous swamp. Gas rises all around you and
a damp mist covers the ground, making it impossible to travel safely, without
carefully picking your way around obstacles. Large, gnarled trees rise above
you. Their moss covered branches block out all traces of the sun. The path
here leads east and west.
