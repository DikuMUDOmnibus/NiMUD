N Hall of Broken Columnades~

The hall of broken columnades meets a chamber to the south with a vault
door, where the entryway is.  Huge chunks of columns have been propped up,
no doubt by our golem friend, creating a makeshift door to the north.  A
broken ornate doorway leads east to the main temple.

broken, with huge chunks of the granite cavern lying on top of them,
indicating a cave in.

N Ancient Alvaki Temple~
Ref 0

The ancient Alvaki temple opens up before you in all of its splendor. 
What a place this must once have been, though now it is nowhere near the
glory of its former days.  Many of the glyphs have been scratched off the
remaining columns, probably by invaders or vandals throughout the centuries.
To the east you can see endless rows of library stacks, though some areas
appear more damaged than others.

This is the primary assembly line of the mob factory. Here, all the

of noise! It seems that the workers are making drunks today. Exits are
east to the secondary assembly line, north and south to the primary
assembly line.
