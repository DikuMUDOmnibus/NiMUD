You stand within one of the most holy places in the realm. This
stunning domed temple once housed the city's worshipers en masse.
Unfortunately, it succumbed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desecrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tongue.
     Wind gusts through the four archways and howls and screams can be
heard from all parts of the city.
