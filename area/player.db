N An Overgrown Thicket~
Ref 0
D
Brown reeds grow around huge granite stones that lay strewn over this
part of the valley.  To the south, you see the remains of an ancient tower,
once standing four stories tall overlooking the valley.  You can see the old
symbols from the Zengalli empire etched in the stones.

N Rear Courtyard~
Ref 0
D
To the north is Bahamut's tower.  The rear courtyard is filled with
fallen stones from the tower's fourth story which collapsed ages ago.  Grass
and moss have overgrown the rocks, creating a eerie feeling of an overgrown
garden - flowering vines creep along the walls and the tower itself, making
the area look very isolated and giving you a deep feeling of sentimentality.
