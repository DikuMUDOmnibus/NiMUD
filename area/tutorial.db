You can move with the following shortcuts: n, s, e, w, ne, se, sw, nw, u,

moving around the world.  It is also useful to type "exits" to view what
exits there are around you.  By glancing a direction, for example "look
north" -- you can see what lies in that direction, and who, if anyone, is
lurking nearby.

Welcome to the movement maze!  You're goal is to find the End of the
Maze.  To do so, you need to traverse a small maze of interconnected rooms
until you find the right one.  You'll know it when you find it!  Use the
movement commands (n,s,e,w,u,d,nw,ne,sw,se) and the "exits" command to
figure out how to get to where you need to go.

Doors can block your path.
 
To familiarize yourself with more advanced navigation features, the
commands "look" and "open" have directional features.
 
For instance, if you look "north" you'll notice there is a door.
 
If you then "open north" you'll be able to then "look north" through
the open door and check to see if anyone is on the other side.
 
Go ahead and try.

Your next decision determines your path to skill.  You may either
start by visiting a small fishing village on the river Kaer, in
the northlands.  Typing "village" takes you there, where you can
learn the arts of survival and start trading.
 
If you wish to go to the big city, type "city" and you will begin
your adventure in Kess, the capital of Kltara, a land of many
opportunities and challenges.  Kltara is a land of rich resources
and plentiful shops and stores with exotic wares.  Here you may
learn a variety of arts and participate in local markets.  It is
suggested that new players, who have never played The Isles before,
start in some place other than the city.
 
If you are built from a warrior's brood, and wish to challenge
yourself in the arts of combat, you may enter the "arena" and
begin fighting at Kara-Tur, the warrior's pit.
 
Please note: these decisions lead you to different trainers and
areas set up for specific sets of skills, which you may learn.
It is possible, however, to travel from one city to the next
in the realm, for a price.

The scroll reads:
Welcome to the Kara-Tuk Arena.  Battles are fought here by both
the meek and the strong, but only the strong survive.  It is recommended
that fighters of veteran caliber fight in the hard matches, while fresh
and inexperienced fighters choose easy.  There is a big gap between
the two, so new fighters should stick to the easy combat until they have
reached adept expertise in at least two offensive and two defensive
combat tactics.
 
Veteran fighters are considered those with the knowledge of several weapons,
advanced defensive tactics, and a hearty understanding of hand to hand.
 
Expert warriors are considered those with mastery of all weapons and
many defensive maneuvers, as well as the understanding of repair and
the ownership of an extensive armory.  Experts are given the option to
challenge the deathmatch, a dangerous and complex fighting arena.

Now you have discovered your inventory, now your next task is to master
your equipment.  Typing "equipment" shows a break-down of what you're
wearing and using, without looking into your packs or other containers. 
Wearing and using objects on different locations is possible, too.  You can
don a cap or wrap a scarf around you with the "^Bwear^N" command.  Type
"help wear" for more details.  With some weapons you can "^Bdraw^N" and
"^Bsheathe^N" using a belt, as well as "^Bremove^N" items to be stored away.
Another, related command is "^Bswap^N" which switches objects between your
two hands, or between one of your hands and a pack in your inventory.

Your game objective for now is to reach Immortality by
becoming a Hero.  To do so, you must gain 99 levels.
 
Once you become Immortal, you join the ranks of volunteers who
help players and work on the game itself.  Angels, for example,
have specifically volunteered to assist new players in need of
information and help.  Type "^Bwizlist^N" to see a list
of *some* of the immortals.

"^Bchat^N" is a channel activated for new players and those interested
in helping them.  It is a "public" channel and may reach several
hundred players.  Bad language is not appropriate on public channels.
Typing "^Bchat I need some help please^N" will usually get
a good response but please remember:
 
1. This is a family MUD.
2. Our players range in age from children to senior citizens, and come
   from a wide variety of countries and cultures.  Not everyone speaks
   English well.  If you need assistance in another language you
   might find someone by typing "^Bchat Does anyone speak French?^N"
3. Good manners and appropriate language are valued here.
4. Those violating these standards may be asked or forced to leave.
 
We highly recommend you take some time looking at our language policy.
Type "^Bhelp policy^N" if you want to look at that now.
 
Please type "^Bwest^N" or the letter W to move to the next room.

You now need to kill an "actor" or "mob" to get some more equipment.
A mob is a general term for any computer-controlled creature in
the game.  When you go south, you will see a Lizard.  
 
You will want to "^Bconsider lizard^N" before attacking it.  It is
unwise to fight something you have not considered.
 
To initiate a fight, type "^Bkill lizard^N" -- you may type the
name lizard, or "^Bk lizard^N" for short.
 
Go south when you are ready.

To remove an item from your INVENTORY you may drop it on the floor
by typing "^Bdrop <xxx>^N" -- items on the floor are NOT safe.
Someone could drop by and just take your item, so keep an eye on
it.  Short periods of time in empty rooms may be safe.
 
"^Bremove <xx>^N" or "^Brem <xx>^N"  take off clothing, armor or jewelry
"^Bdrop <xx>^N"     drops an item, if you type "^Blook^N" you'll see it
"^Bget <xx>^N"      gets something off of the floor
 
Try this, and "^Blook^N" at the room before you leave to be SURE you
have left nothing behind:
"^Bremove belt^N", "^Bdrop belt^N", "^Blook^N", "^Bg belt^N", "^Bwear belt^N"
 
Go north to continue.

and items.  You will also get the experience points from your
combat successes.  The command "^Bworth^N" or "^Bmoney^N" tells
you how much you have.  
 
Once you gain 1000 experience points, you will gain a level.

You are in a damp, mouldy dungeon.  Moans and disturbing noises
tell you that all is not well here.  In the next five chambers
there are creatures for you to kill.  Each has equipment you need
for your journey.  Make sure to "^Bconsider^N" your opponents
and "^Bkill^N" each of them.  Watch your health!  It is
safe to sleep here to regain health and fatigue.  Remember to
type "^Bsleep^N" and "^Bwake^N" to do this.

If you don't see it, someone may have just killed it.  Wait a bit

Congratulations!  You have graduated!  There is one last little
lesson before we send you on your way:
 
There is a special command called "^Bhome^N" which transports you
back to your hometown.  You can always type "^Bhome^N" if you
lose your bearings or end up in a tight spot.
 
Keep in mind that there are reprocussions to your actions.  In
your "^Bscore^N" there is a rating of your ^Bkarma^N, which
is a rating of what types of enemies you are killing.  Try not
to fight the good guys!  (Unless you want to.)
 
Type ^Bhome^N to return to your hometown.
