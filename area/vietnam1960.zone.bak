Soldiers must learn to navigate, the four corners (north, south, east
and west) as well as non-cardinal directions (northeast, northwest, etc)
to survive in the jungle.
 
Careful scrutiny of medical supplies in the field is imperative to
a soldier's survival.  Use of medical supplies should be rationed.
 
Knowledge of "shoot" and melee combat is essential.  Use of survival
knives, bayonets and other weapons may aid combat.
 
The field officer has scrawled a note at the bottom of the page:
"Watch out grunts, Charlie's got your six.  Learn to look both
ways before crossing the Me Kong Trail."
 
On the back is a list of relevant commands:
Shoot, Sheathe, Kill, Draw, Reload, Flee, Rescue and Assist

N Muoc Dar - Saigon Military Base~
Ref 0
D
You are standing in the center of the basecamp in Muoc Dar, a relatively
quiet part of the bush.  To the east is the military stockade, where they
keep prisoners awaiting trial on war crimes.  To the north is the mess tent,
and to the west is the hospital.  A steady flow of traffic moves in and out
of the base to the south.

N Muoc Dar - Hospital~
Ref 0
D
Patients are moved from here to the military hospitals at the mainbase
closer to Saigon.  The Muoc Dar outpost is a bustling field outpost, often
seeing causualties from operations within the territories.  Seems rather
quiet today, not too many wounded.
