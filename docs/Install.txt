First, it is important that you do not follow these instructions if you
are logged in as root.  Log in as a different user, and then follow
these instructions.  If you don't have root access on the machine you
are on, don't worry about this comment.

Installation Notes
------------------

There are four steps to this process, follow each one carefully:

1. Extract files (if you are reading this you already have) using:
tar -zxvf archive_name.tar

2. Modify filepath and port variables in file 'startup' in the main
directory you've installed the software into.

3. Modify filepath variable in files 'recompile', 'refresh' and 'package'
to reflect the full path and directory of the location of the software
and all of its related files.

4. Add to crontab or type from the command line:
nohup ./startup &

NOTE: To stop a runaway startup process, a 'stop' script has been
provided in the same directory as the above scripts.
