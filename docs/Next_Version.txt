What's Next
-----------



The next version of NiM5 will come with some major in-game systems to round out the 
final "fifth" version of NiMUD.

These systems are the "castles" system, which provides the fiefdom/kingdom-level 
combat and rewards system, a higher-level clan-like system for hero characters who 
wish to "rule" part of Tyselorrd, the "land of the tyrants" and serves as the main 
motivation for becoming a hero.

I considered that system to be fairly unique to fantasy mudding, and an extension of 
existing 'housing' systems, something pretty new to multiplayer games, and different 
that existing systems in other muds such as "owning a player-run shop" or "creating a 
clan" -- in this case, a hero can acquire other lesser mortals as heirarchical 
vassals, and head their own clan.

The other two systems will be the 'pet' system reimplementation, which also includes a 
"hirelings" system which is slightly different than the 'petshop' system.

Finally, it will include a complete reimplementation of Diku spells, as well as some 
"NiMUD" spells which are different and more complex; a finalized trading system and a 
completed alchemical system, the basis of which is already present in the current 
version and could be created "from scratch" using this version.
