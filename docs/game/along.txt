Along the winding road
 I'd thought we'd surely ride
Bonded with my steel
 Entrusted by my side
And I was there a-thinking
 of all the worlds that we'd create
Remembering times astern
 as we passed the city gates
 
I- --- I I I--- yiyi

And as I walked along
 that gnarled and twisted path
I remember times
 long ago that surely passed

I- --- I I I--- yiyi

And as the dandling cypress
 fades into the winds
I find myself a-walking
 toward an unfound end
Whose to say I'm empty
 Bound above the fjords
For I sleep under starlight
 And silversheen out of doors

I- --- I I I--- yiyi

Back beyond the ages
 My homeland hills a-faded
Now I'm lost in wilderness
 And all my thoughts are jaded
Signal fires dot the woods
 And I walk along
I carry the seed of many
 Within these sinewed arms

I- --- I I I--- yiyi

My father's father's craftsmen
 forged beneath the seas
In cavern deep we'd learn to sleep
 Our enemies on their knees
