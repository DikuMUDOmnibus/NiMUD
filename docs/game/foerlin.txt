        From the Author

        This text is written solely for the purpose of outline and explaining
    the different aspects of the Tyselorrd game, specifically the parts of
    the world which are important to playing on The Isles MUD.  The ideas
    contained herein are solely owned by the author, Herb Gilliland.  He
    reserves the right to modify, omit or remove any of this at any time.
        Foerlin's Tome of the Realms is written in the first person in order
    to make it entertaining as well as informative.  Foerlin's persona is
    defined in the 'From Foerlin' section of this introduction.

        From Foerlin

        It was upon the last day of my boyhood that I decided to set myself
    out and visit the world, scribing its details into my battered testemony
    of travels.  A leatherbound manual and a ink-and-quill pen were my only
    supplies as I unhitched my father's mount from the stables, bid goodbye
    to my mother, and set off on our short dirt drive for Keveg, a mile
    walk later I had found my way into the town.
        This Tome of the Realms is an organized version of my journal's
    account.  I have compiled this information for all of my adult life,
    and am proud to be able to offer this information to you, dear reader.
    It describes, in detail, almost everything I have encountered during
    my exploration of my homeland, the Southern Isles of Jharl.  Economic,
    editorial and factual accounts are contained herein, and, to my
    knowledge, are the complete truth as I know it.  Please excuse any
    errors on my part; any errors are my ignorance entirely.
        For convenience, I have alphabetized whenever possible.

----------------[    Part 1:  Geographical Atlas    ]----------------------
                     
        Throughout my travels, it was necessary to transcribe or
    fold and log maps of the areas in which I travelled.  Because I did
    not travel to every location described here, some areas lack maps,
    or I have chosen to omit a poor representation of the location.
    Any cartography should be considered rough, not exact, and I urge
    you to visit my shop whenever you find yourself in Keveg.  I sell
    a myriad of useful Atlases and maps, of many denominations and
    scales.  You are welcome to browse or buy, depending on the size
    of your coinpurse.

                                             but are not detailed here.


- [The Corse]

        The Corse is the southernmost island in the Jharl archipelago.
    It is on the fringe of subarctic climes, and very inhospitable.
    There are no known settlements on The Corse.  Likewise, no one
    has ever settled here for very long.  Legends of the island's
    inhabitants, however, are widely known.  It is believed by many
    that The Corse is the Isle of the Dead, where all persons lost
    at sea may find themselves haunting.  I myself have never visit
    the island.  I encourage you to read the Legends and Lore section
    for more specific information.
 
- [Grand Ocean]

        East of the Southern Isles of Jharl and south of the lukewarm
    waters of the Newcost Bay lies the Grand Ocean, an expanse of
    choppy, foggy saltwater.  The Grand Ocean is a vast, landless
    body of water that has never been traversed.  It is the belief
    of many a scholar that there is a land on the other side of the
    world, across the Grand Ocean, which is exactly opposite to that
    of Tyselorrd.  I was once aboard a fisherman's sloop when we
    drifted out from shore and were caught in a dangerous storm.  The
    high winds blew us further away from the safety of land, until
    we were a day's travel from any point.  By the stars, we were able
    to guide our ship back to safety, but it was during this time
    I first began to understand the reasons why no one had ever
    traversed this vast ocean.  With no known goals, one could drift
    aimlessly until short of supplies and lack of fresh water killed
    a man.  It would take a great feat of strength, or insanity, to
    ever cross this ocean and visit the other side of the world.
        Aside from the awe-inspiring size of this ocean, the Grand
    Ocean has plentiful supplies of fish near land areas, and thus
    is a breadbasket for the fishing industry.

- [Mudak Island]

        Mudak Island is an uninhabited island that may have once been
    but a sandbar.  Over time, however, this island has grown in size
    and could support a few structures, but the sandy soil of the
    isle is harsh and difficult to cultivate.  During the thaw, the
    ocean levels rise slightly, causing heavy flooding on the island,
    turning many areas to quicksand.  Once when I took to the seas
    to apprentice navigation, the captain of the vessel stopped here
    for repairs.  Not much vegatation grows on the sandy beaches of
    Mudak, but what does is fruitbearing and lush.  Perhaps some
    generations in the future may be able to cultivate the indigenous
    crops that flourish here: and nowhere else.  I tried to transplant
    one of the gulgafruit bushes from Mudak to the sandy shores of
    the Serpantine Isle, but my work was to no avail.  Such a rare
    delicacy is that of gulgafruit pie.

        Rygor Isle is the largest and most populated island of the
    Southern Isles of Jharl.  It is at the northern tip of the island
    chain.  The peoples of Rygor Isle are varied and spread from its
    most northern beaches to its most southern cape.
        
 ---- Landforms
     
   -- Andraius Mountains
   
        The Andraius Mountains drag a swath across the center of
        Rygor Isle, driving a rift between the two halves of the Island.
        The mountains are easily bypassed through the northern grasslands,
        however both the Kralan Pass and Travellers Pass have been found
        to make traveling more direct.  A few stray mountains can be
        found to the southwest of the main chain.  Formerly called the 
        Little Andraius, they are now considered to be part of the main
        mountain range.
   
   -- Blood Lake
   
        The northern Andraius Mountains contain high deposits of iron,
        and for this reason they are mined frequently.  Mountain streams,
        tapped for use in mining, fill with iron dust.  The iron dust
        soon rusts, turning the water a deep red.  This red color is
        seen most brilliantly in the waters of Blood Lake.  Many religions
        have risen and fallen by the shores of this freshwater lake.       
 
   -- The Broken Coast
   
        A craggy, broken coastline follows the northwestern side of the
        island, creating a treacherous landscape unfit for ocean faring
        vessels.  The shore leads quickly from dangerous seas to blistering
        hotlands, as the dry scrublands and western deserts fade east
        into the endless western plains of Rygor Isle.  The fishless
        expanse of the Watervoid lies west, a forboding addition to this
        dead land.

   -- Cape Red
   
        The southern tip of Rygor Isle forms a wide cape and breakwater,
        creating a natural port for ships.  Inland from the cape is
        a forest and river.  The cape's waters are rich in both saltwater
        and freshwater sea life, and provide the second largest amount
        of fish and seafood for the islands, seconded only to the Grand
        Ocean.
        
   -- Crystal River
   
        A bed of spongerock creates a natural falls only a few thousand
        yards from Blood Lake.  This waterfall serves as a natural filter,
        removing the reddish rust hue from the waters and creating the
        crystal clear water of the Crystal River.  The sight of the red
        falls flowing over the spongerock and splashing, clear, into
        the pool below is an awe-inspiring site.  One can't help feel
        a bit of magic in the area.  It is the legends of the place that
        pass from lips to ear in this area, local recluses always spend
        time spinning yarns to travellers.  Flowing first north from 
        Blood lake, then east, the Crystal River empties into the 
        Grand Ocean, spilling thousands of freshwater fish into the small
        delta at the shoreline. 
        
   -- Eastern Plains
   
        A dry, uncultivated spacious area lies south of the Crystal River
        and east of the Andraius Mountains.  This area, known only as
        the Eastern Plains, is dotted with small camps and settlements.
        The fading lines of old roads, falling now into ruin, crisscross
        the landscape here.  It is legend that says once a great king
        ruled here.  But now only a few crumbling structures remain.        

   -- Gemrider River
     
        A fast-flowing fish-infested waterway flows south from the Andraius
        and emties into the Watervoid just northwest of Cape Red.  The
        Gemrider River is the largest gem mine and geode site in all of
        the Isles, containing far more precious stones than any other
        river.  Even though the Gemrider River may not contain the largest
        number of precious stones, the Gemmaster's Guild in Kyrinn prefers
        Gemrider stones to others due to their unequaled perfection and
        relatively large number of usable specimens.
        
   -- Kltara
   
        Kltara is the name given to the foothills, piedmonts and plains
        just south of the northeastern cliffs, before the land becomes
        harsh and barren.  Kltara is rich in vegetation and wildlife,
        Kltara sports a rather large number of game.

        It is of note that Kltara has become the name for all of the
        land over which King Rygor sovreigns.

 ---- Cities
 
   -- Port of Cape Red
   
        The Port of Cape Red, or the Port for short, is the second
        largest city in all of the Isles.  My travels to the Port have
        been many.  The Port is a rich place, populated by many nobles
        and rich merchant guilds.  It is here that the Dwarven Merchant
        Guild is most predominant, controlling a large profit share
        of the market.  The Port is known for its wide trading and
        exotic flare.  While Kess has The Great Bazaar to promote
        trading, the Port has no such pleasantry.  The Port is the main
        shipping location.  Daily, the Port is filled with foriegn
        travellers, journeymen, traders and diplomats, making this
        city a multicultural location.  More languages are spoken here
        than there are streets, it may seem, but in the end most of the
        Port's inhabitants speak the universal language of trade.  The
        Port is a fairly rich city, seconded only in its universities
        to Kess.  The Port is also a big place for caravans to drop
        off or pick up trading material to take to Kess or ship to
        the mainland.  When your in the Port, make sure to keep a pouch
        full of money and a dagger at your waste.  My adventures in this
        city are numerous, and most of them involve some sort of danger,
        so I urge newcomers to be on guard at all times.
   
   -- Kess
   
        Kess is the capital of Kltara and Rygor Isle, and very well may
        be the capital of the entire archipelago.  It is the largest
        and most diverse city, containing great schools of knowledge,
        the largest number of independant craftsman, and many unique
        local attractions.  Kess is built around the Crystal River
        which flows through the heart of the city.  The city is split
        into two main sections.  The first is the South Bank, where
        most of the merchandom, artistry and cultural experiences lie.
        The South Bank is seperated into a number of districts, far
        too numerous and volatile to mention.  The second is the North
        Bank, where political, government and education facilities lie.
        It is the North Bank which contains Rygor Castle, the Coranos
        Lycaeum and many other government facilities.  The North Bank
        is seperated into two main districts: the High Court, containing
        mostly government buildings (perched on a hill) and the Riverside
        District, containing the Lycaeum and other university sites.
        Outside the city walls, Kess sports a small crop of rye, barley,
        oats and wheat.  A local establishment, the Hovelcove, has some
        of the best fresh-baked bread I have ever tasted.
        
    - The Great Bazaar
    
        The huge Kess Plaza near the South Gate houses a year-round
        festival called the Great Bazaar.  The Bazaar is both a sale
        and an extravagant party.  An amphitheater has been constructed
        in the western center of the Plaza, allowing the stage to be
        used for performances.  On the outskirts of the Plaza are
        numberous tents, wagons and buildings, many perminant, which
        house the outlets for all the major merchant houses.  It is here
        that one can buy, first hand, many finished goods, raw materials,
        or sell components, spices or otherwise.  "If you can't find it
        at the Great Bazaar," I have heard many times, "It doesn't exist."
        
    - Rygor Castle
     
        The modest King built himself a heavily fortified and open
        castle on a gnoll on the North Bank.  The Castle is rather
        large and well built, containing many meeting houses and
        government buildings.  It is here that one may ask to be
        granted audience with the King himself.  
        
    - Coranos Lycaeum

        This structure is the second largest library in the known world,
        second only to the Athenaeum in Kyrinn.  Many tomes are contained
        within these walls.  I am proud to be able to say, with truth,
        that it also contains many detailed and expensive maps which I,
        Foerlin, have been so kind to donate.  It is said the Lycaeum's
        basement contains the only remaining entrance to the catacombs
        of Kess.  Whether this rumor is true, I would not be able to say.
        Needlessly, my short time as assistant librarian in the facility
        gave me access to certain areas which were not of public access.
        In all my investigative efforts, I was never able to uncover
        any secret passage that may lead to an entrance or crawlspace.    
    
   -- Keveg
   
        Ah, Keveg, my hometown.  A quaint little hamlet northwest of
        the Port of Cape Red, Keveg is where I keep shop and spend
        my old age resting blissfully in the land of my birth.  Keveg
        is a village surrounded by vineyards; it has the most sweet
        and tart wines on the isle.  Of note, Keveg has a fair number
        of craftsman who are happy to take on an apprentice now and 
        again.  I myself have taught many the lessons of navigation
        and cartography.
    
   -- The Lighthouse

        For nine generations, there has always been a fisherman and his
        family tending the lighthouse southeast of the isle.  The current
        owners and caretakers sell their fish to passing ships.  Though
        fishselling on their small rocky crag is hardly enough to keep
        them, they have been declared tax-free by Coranos Rygor.  Without
        taxes, with a bountiful supply of fish, and with a constant
        supplie of fuel from the Port's holding stock, the Lighthouse
        attendants live an honest and fair life.  They welcome travellers
        with open arms and are happy to rent out their spare lodging
        whenever necessary.   

   -- Vesper
   
        Vesper is a medium sized farming village along the road which leads
        from Kess to the Port of Cape Red.  Vesper has the largest crop
        yield in the archipelago.  Vesper's citizenry sell their food
        surplus to both the merchant houses and the Great Bazaar every
        year, aside from their own independant markets in the town.  My
        visits to Vesper have always been memorable; the food their is
        among the most excellent and hearty in the land.
    
 ---- Places of interest
 
   -- Southern Forest
   
        The southern forest surrounding the road which leads to the
        Port of Cape Red is the legendary home of the Drev and Buckawn.
        It is filled with independant, reclusive and secretive villages,
        usually small, and is a favored place for Thilonenne middle-age
        purging efforts.

   -- Ruins of Wound Spire

        The Wound Spire is a crumbling structure which can be seen from
        certain locations in the Andraius Mountains.  The Spire itself
        was some sort of religious place, and is along one of the slopes
        of the Andraius mountains.  I myself have never visited this
        forboding place, but I have heard stories of some of the more
        gruesome happenings that have occured here.   

   -- Dakonenne City, Triev
   
        Beneath the northeastern plateau is Treiv, the Dakonenne capital.
        Dakonenne are an ignorant bunch of xenophobic elves, and should
        not be approached unless with cautionary measures taken.  I don't
        have a very strong liking toward them, but I don't really hate
        any Dakons either.  I just don't know them, and they don't seem
        to want to know me.

        The Serpantine Isle was only recently inhabited.  When Luke Kthana
    decided to use this island for refuge, many others followed.  Today,
    the isle is one of the more populated islands.  

 ---- Landforms

   -- Serpant Mountains

        A snaking range of high, sharp peaks shapes its spinal sinusoidal
        way through the middle of the island.  On the western edge is
        dry scrublands.  To the east is lush forest and the fog-enshrouded
        Shadow Peak.

   -- Shadow Peak
   
        Shadow Peak is a mysterous volcanic mountain.  A blanket of
        half-fog half-steam covers the base of the mountain and keeps the
        forests and swamps their shrouded from view.  This base land is
        treacherous and acts as a moat of sorts for those who wish to
        traverse the volcano and climb to its peak.  It is speculated
        by scholars and bards alike that great riches, powerful gems
        and deadly creatures live within the rim of the searing magma
        crater.

 ---- Cities

   -- Bristol
    
        Bristol is a large farming village, feeding most of the populous
        of the Serpantine Isle.  Bristol contains a large estate owned
        by Lord Luke Kthana, and many of the citizens of Bristol that
        aren't farmers are actually Kthana's servants and army.

   -- Keep Kthana
    
        A small village and keep at the mouth of the nameless river
        which flows between bristol and the sea, Keep Kthana is
        in a strategically sound location perched atop a high cliff.
        The villagers are all servants of the castle, and have their
        right place in flocking to the castle should a seige occur.

   -- Lovers' Nest
   
        Originally a small estate for Kthana and his Queen, the
        Lovers' Nest has grown to the size of a small city.  Catering
        to exotic foriegn travellers seeking refuge here.  The Lovers'
        Nest is designed to accomodate both single visitors and couples,
        specializing in romantic hiatus.

- [Soedar Isle]

        Claimed by fair skinned, fair haired nomadic dwarves several
        centuries ago, Soedar continues to be the site of dwarven
        settlements today.  Because I am not of dwarven decent, I have
        never been able to visit this island and its peoples.  Only
        from rumor and common knowledge have I been able to learn
        anything at all.

 ---- Kreighaad
 
        The foremost dwarven city in the Isle, and stronghold, Kreighaad
        is supposedly an invulnerable fortress.  Perhaps more out of
        respect than factual evidence, the Kreighaad fort has never been
        reported to have been successfully breached in all the records
        of Kyrinn's Athenaeum.

- [Tyselorrd (Mainland)]

        Tyselorrd, also known by many as the Land of the Tyrants, is
        a vast continent spliced by fuedal fiefdoms and tribal
        rivalries.  Over six hundred seperate groups can be found on
        the surface of this land mass, and as many as fifty beneath
        its surface.  Known to scholars as the Infestation of the
        Civilized World, Tyselorrd is the largest known land mass in
        all of the known world.  I have traveled only to Kyrinn on
        business, and my knowledge of the continent is limited only to
        a few rough maps I bought in the Kyrinn cartographer's office.
        The stock of ancient maps in the Athenaeum gave me a good idea
        of the geographic lay of the land, but the constantly shifting
        political bounds are usually never mapped correctly.  Tyselorrd
        is covered with mostly wetlands of low vegetation; much of the
        soil is volcanic ash, and, while fertile, the constant eruption
        of volcanoes usually blankets the land in new layers of ash and
        rock every three months.  Outside of this large lava swath that
        cuts its way across the mainland are a plethora of rivers and
        lakes, usually surrounded by small groves of trees or thick
        vegetation.  In the north the volcanos are not as massive but
        remain active, keeping the area free of ice to a large degree.
        It is here that many call home, due to the warm weather and
        fertile, non-desctructive soil.  On the coastlines, the population
        is the greatest.  The father away you get from the Volcano Rift
        Valley, the more hospitable the land becomes.  The most exotic
        trees and shrubs grow along this area, providing food for the
        towns and mountainous terrain good for hunting, gathering and
        war.  War is probably the most abundant raw material on the
        Mainland, there are always one or two factions declaring war on
        another few.  The Isles benifit from their relative peace, while
        the Land of the Tyrants is in constant conflict with itself.
        Dark magicians, vile knights and evil warmongers seem to populate
        the land more than calm, civilized folk.  The constantly overcast
        skies of the Rift Valley seem to fortell the dark future of the
        peoples of this continent.

 ---- Newcost Bay
 
        A lukewarm bay laying on a continental shelf, the Newcost Bay
        is a wide area of shallow reefs and treacherous rocky outcroppings.
        Many small piers have been constructed along its wide C-shaped
        banks.  I've docked at many, which are usually untended and
        decrepit.  There are ruins along the shore here, of towns and
        villages, castles and great buildings, buildings of which I have
        never seen the like.  I encourage you to read the historical
        and legendary data I have included in this tome to further your
        knowledge of these structures.

 ---- Cities

   -- Kyrinn
   
        Capital of the known world, as it has been called, but more
        officially capital of Tyselorrd, Kyrinn is now the site for
        two of the world's most famous groups.  The Tiktui imperial 
        seat has been recently moved to Kyrinn, joining the Gemmaster's
        Guild in this ancient city.  I regret I have not seen much of
        the city except the four walls of the Gemmaster's Guild and
        the wonderful Athenaeum.

    - Athenaeum
    
        The Athenaeum in Kyrinn is the largest library in the known
        world, containing works as ancient as the first circle and as
        recent as this tome itself.  This is the most complete library
        to date.

   -- Nostol
   
        A city-state ruled by King Haedar the Fourth.  Nostol is a
        city filled with warmongers and cutthroat political ambitionists.
        Its qualms, however, spread very little outside the reach of
        the city-state.  At one time, before the rise of Tiktui, Nostol
        ruled Kyrinn and all of Tyselorrd, before it was crushed and
        contained to its home peninsula.

- [Watervoid]
 
        The Watervoid, at least the Watervoid along the Broken Coast
        of Rygor Isle, is a poisonous, rough, landless sea of fishless
        waters.  The salt content of the water is extremely high, 
        and the lack of fish in the waters is attributed to this.  Near
        areas where the Watervoid mingles with other waters (such as
        river outlets or the Grand Ocean) fish are able to thrive in
        diluted water.  The Watervoid is even more treacherous to
        traverse than the Grand Ocean due to its lack of fish, making
        sailors rely on cured meats and salted fish on deck; food
        which may eventually go bad or run low.  No one has ever
        successfully crossed this ocean.

- [Zalufin]

        Zalufin is the home to the noble Trioskenne elves.  It is a
        rich mountainous island of hills and valleys, covered mainly
        in a thick forest of conifers.  This is the only island that
        the exotic kio sap can be found, a sweet and tart alcohol-like
        narcotic.  

 ---- Cities

   -- Toshan Kori

        The exotic city of Toshan Kori is home to the Trioskenne.  These
        elves spend their days and nights civilizing each other, and
        the task seems to be one of sheer delight to each of them.  It
        is a magickal place, and also a place which I have travelled
        only once.  The city is a most brilliant white color, with the
        buildings repainted and whitewashed every few months to keep
        the "civilized" sheen of the town.  The spires are constantly
        increasing in height as Trioskenne nobles and dignitaries try
        to out-build one another.

----------------[    Part 2:  Glossary of the Realms    ]------------------

- [Peoples]

      This section describes the different races on the Isles, not in the
      world as a whole.  There are approximately fifteen other races
      planet-wide, not all are known to me.  In your travels in The Isles,
      these are probably the only sentient members of society that you
      will ever meet.  Orcs, ogres and other creatures are considered
      animals or half-men, and are not listed in this index.  A good friend
      of mine, Locke, has offered to write this section for me from a more
      objective standpoint. 

 ---- Human Races

      Human races all share the same makeup of the root race, the human
      being.  It is through magick or nature that certain humans are born
      normal, while others are larger or smaller in size.  Human races
      populate the isles far more than any other race, and human races are
      the most diverse and varied of all the races. 

   -- Human

          The human is the most basic, average of all the races.  They 
      are also the most populated amongst the islands.  Humans all have a
      unique curiosity which many of the other races lack, and humans can 
      range from a short, lythe elflike creature, to a large, muscular 
      swordsman.  Humans and dwarves are the only races which are not 
      native to the islands.

      Physical traits:
      Varied (use your humanity to hewn your character).
      Age gracefully, living between 100 and 150 years.

      How to roleplay this race:
      This race has the most freedom and diversity, since it is not as 
      bound to itself as the other races are known to be.  Use your own
      experiences at being human to shape your character, or the 
      experiences of others.  You're best at being human, so your 
      character should be well developed.

      Human, being the most diverse of races, can be pretty much any type
      of class or occupation.

      Humans are limited to a knowledge of roughly 50 skills in their 
      lifetime.
      Humans gain no bonuses to their initial statistics.
      Humans suffer no penalties to their initial statistics.

   -- Dwarf

          Dwarves are stout, short, stocky humans with a keen eye for 
      certain less mystical aspects of the world.  Dwarves are incredibly 
      practical creatures.  They stand a trifle over half the size of an 
      average human, and are very muscular.  Dwarves are as diverse as 
      humans, aside from their limiting height and slightly less 
      metaphysical understandings. They are extremely brazen individuals, 
      possessing an in-born ability of infravision.

      Physical traits:
      Short, stocky and muscular.
      Possessing thick beards and long hair of red, brown, grey, white or
      blond denominations.
      Eyes can range from violet to orange to green, and all colors in 
      between, save red and white (for obvious reasons).
      Age gracefully, living between 100 and 150 years.

      How to roleplay this race:
      Dwarves are, in part, human.  Aside from their slightly different
      skills and their height difference, dwarves retain most all of their
      human features.  They can participate in many activities a human 
      would.  It is their differing personality which greatly seperates 
      the two closely related races.

      A dwarf would most likely be anything from a weaponsmith to a 
      merchant. Several dwarven merchant guilds have joined the 
      Consortium, and are quite effective in the markets of fine 
      hand-crafted items.  Dwarves are very good with pragmatic 
      situations, preferring to stay away from magical practices.  Dwarves 
      were highly competative with the Tinkergnomes in this region,
      and now have formed their own Dwarven Merchant's Guild.

      Dwarves are closely related to humans, and are not at all related to
      Drev or Buckawn.

      Dwarves are limited to a knowledge of 40 skills in their lifetime.
      Dwarves gain bonuses to strength and constitution.
      Dwarves suffer penalties to dexterity, intelligence and wisdom.

   -- Giant
   
          Giants are the product of gemmaster engineering.  Certain 
      gemmasters have been able to affect the womb of a human mother into
      birthing a child of giant proportions.  Giants are the product of 
      this engineering.  Part of the main problem with Giants is their 
      ineptitude at exact tasks such as spellcasting, gemmastering and 
      tasks which require stealth or precision.  Their deep voices and 
      overwelming demeanor make them charismatically ineffective.

      Physical traits:
      Really, really tall humans (like three-four meters).
      Age gracefully, living between 100 and 125 years.

      How to roleplay this race:
      Giants tend to be hired hands.  They are good for hard labor, and are
      even better as men of arms.  Their lack of dexterity is made up for
      with their ability to wield a weapon to a proper degree, and to do
      enough damage in order to slay said opponent.  Giants, however, do have
      a bit of trouble finding proper attire, as most shops do not taylor
      to their size.

      A giant in the current age would become a bouncer for a local
      establishment or a hired guard.  Giants lack stealth and magical
      ability, and would not make good apprentices in these fields.  Giants
      are extremely good fighters, weaponsmasters and specialist, and for
      this reason they are valued above all other races for armies.

      Giants are descendant from humans through magical manipulation by
      gemmasters.

      Giants are limited to a knowledge of 25 skills in their lifetime.
      Giants gain bonuses to strength and constitution.
      Giants suffer penalties to wisdom and dexterity.

 ---- Elven Races

          There are three elven races, presumably from decendant from
      either one of the existing elven races or from a now-extinct master
      race.  The Dakonenne, Thilonenne and Trioskenne have evolved to now
      be totally different creatures in their personality and tendancies.
      Elves, if you count each of the three races populations together,
      are the second most abundant race in the populous. 

   -- Dakonenne 

          The Dakonenne are a race of xenophobic subterrainean humanoids
      which have no desire to participate in the society of other races.
      They dislike other races so inherently that they feign ignoranace 
      to their existance on many occaisions; otherwise they are warmongers
      and fight and pillage until their threat is abated.  Given the 
      choice, however, Dakonenne will not go out of their way to cause
      trouble, unless their territory or their people are threatened.  Due
      to their underground lifestyle, Dakon possess the inate ability of
      infravision, sensing heat as well as light.

      Physical traits:
      White, grey or black hair.
      Dark skin, nearly pitch black.
      Thier eyes lack iris coloration, and are spheres of pure white.
      With a lean and stocky build, usually they possess facial hair.
      Age slowly, living 250 to 300 years underground, 250-275 above.

      How to roleplay this race:
      Dakonenne are xenophobes, yet they do not possess a language unique
      to their underground lifestyle.  Dakonenne dispise disturbance, and
      are quickly moved to cold, unceasing violence when provoked.  
      Dakonenne fight amongst themselves nearly as often as with other
      races, but are silent creatures, usually never arguing.  Dakonenne
      have been compared to vipers, snakes which hiss and banter, then 
      sting with deadly poison.

      Dakonenne have a diverse subculture, based around the element of 
      Water, the major fuel of their underground mills.  Dakonenne are
      wonderful swordcrafters, mediocre gemmasters, and a large percentage
      of the Dakon population remain mushroom farmers.  In recent times,
      Dakonenne have  been known to form plunder-groups to raid the
      surrounding countryside for food to feed their hungry populous.

      Dakonenne are closely related to Trioskenne and Thilonenne, and can
      be referred to as either 'Dakonenne', a formal and widely-accepted
      plural or singular noun, or as 'Dakon', singular, or 'Dakos', plural,
      both being informal and rarely used.

      Dakonenne are limited to a knowledge of 55 skills in their lifetime.
      Dakonenne gain bonuses to strength, intelligence and wisdom.
      Dakonenne suffer penalties to dexterity and constitution.

   -- Thilonenne

          Thilonenne are civilied forest-dwelling creatures.  They stand
      slightly shorter than a human, and are of a lighter build.  
      Thilonenne possess a greater dexterity in their musculature, but 
      tend to be feeble and easily hurt.  Thilonenne are highly religous
      and very close to the element of Earth.  Thilonenne circles of 
      thought extend from the gemmaster's guild in Kess to the wild forests
      of southern Kltara. The Thilonenne are born with certain detection
      abilities, especially that of detection of hidden creatures.

      Physical traits:
      Dark coloration of skin, usually tan or dark peach.
      Eyes are usually brown or golden, similar to that of a feline.
      Lithe build.
      Thilonenne relish extravagant bodypainting.
      Age gracefully, living between 100 and 150 years.

      How to roleplay this race:
      Compared to other related races, Thilonenne tend to be more free-
      spirited and reclusive, preferring their tribes to towns and cities.
      Many refuse to use metal or edged weapons, preferring bows and
      cudgels.  In addition, a thilon is known to purge himself of
      impurities at a late age, and turn itself completely to nature,
      going without supplies for weeks on end.

      Thilonenne will usually become rangers, hunters, Earth mystics or
      Earthen gemmasters.  While they have no qualms with Kltarian society,
      they prefer a wild and unregulated "natural" lifestyle.

      Thilonenne are closely related to Trioskenne and Dakonenne.  They
      can be referred to as 'Thilonenne', a formal plural or singular
      noun, as 'Thilos', a plural informal noun, or as 'Thilon(s)', an
      informal and rarely used noun which can be singular or plural.

      Thilos are limited to a knowledge of roughly 50 skills in their
      lifetime.
      Thilos gain bonuses in intelligence and dexterity.
      Thilos suffer penalties in strength and constitution.

   -- Trioskenne

      In high society, no other race is more respected than the Trioskenne.
      Trioskenne are masters of politics, social conquest and conspiracy.
      They live on the upper threshold of society, in rich company.
      Trioskenne are not the strongest of races, but possess powerful minds
      and quick reflexes.  Trioskenne are not thrifty merchants, but high
      society schemers, tending to enjoy the company of quality and luxury.
      Trioskenne are slightly shorter than the average human.

      Physical traits:
      Fair skin, near white.
      Dark, whimisical eyes of green or violet.
      Long, unkempt blond or silver hair.
      Lithe build, fair features.
      Age gracefully, living between 200 and 250 years.

      How to roleplay this race:
      Trioskenne form three or four circles of power in each city, to which
      most  elong.  Each circle is basically a seperate private conspiracy.
      Those Triosk which choose independance are usually freelancers.
      Trioskenne are known for their suicidal tendencies when forced to
      succumb to poverty, after long periods of abject denial.

      Trioskenne will usually become Merchants, though they prefer not to 
      involved with actual sales.  Trioskenne like wealth and enjoy ordering
      others around.  With due course, they are great thinkers, but have
      tremendous egos.  Rarely do they flaunt themselves to those who are
      of a lesser stature to them, preferring to brown-nose with those of
      a higher position.

      Trioskenne are closely related to Thilonenne and Dakonenne.
      Trioskenne can be referred to as 'Trioskenne', a formal noun which
      can take on the meaning of plural or singular according to context,
      or as 'Triosk', an informal singular or plural noun also according
      to context.

      Triosk are limited to a knowledge of roughly 60 skills in their
      lifetime. 
      Triosk gain bonuses to wisdom, intelligence and dexterity.
      Triosk suffer penalties to strength and constitution.

 ---- Unique Races

          These races are completely unique unto themselves, and are not
      related to any other race.  They live in their own community, or
      are starting to integrate into regular society, and are not decendant
      within themselves or from any other living race.  The races listed
      here are not related unto each other.

   -- Buckawn

          Buckawn are a race of forest brownies that have joined ordinary
      society. They are nearly double the size of a normal brownie, nearly
      the same height as a dwarf.  Buckawn are extremely fast, almost to
      a mystical degree, and are extremely wise.

      Physical traits:
      Whitish hair, no exceptions save blond and near-white yellow.
      Males usually possess mustaches.
      Dark skin, tanned.
      Eyes are usually brown or blue, rarely green or otherwise.

      How to roleplay this race;
      Buckawn are esoteric, but not highly secretive, and feel as though
      they are more crafty than the other races.  Most integrated buckawn
      are interested in stealing from society rather than contributing to
      it.  They are freeloaders, usually lazy, and heavy drinkers.  They
      enjoy music, living in the forest, and collecting expensive and 
      extravagant gems.

      Buckawn are not overly interested in religion or magic, and tend to
      focus themselves on acts of stealth.  They have formed at least one
      underground thieving guild, and their interests usually end at
      monetary gain.

      Buckawn are unique, and are not closely related to any other race.

      Buckawn are limited to a knowledge of 50 skills in their lifetime.
      Buckawn gain bonuses to wisdom and dexterity.
      Buckawn suffer penalties to strength and constitution.

   -- Drev
   
          The Drev race is a primitive subculture that has only recently
      begun to integrate into society.  The Drev are highly religous,
      showing the traits of being crude but wise, daft at times, but
      remaining somewhat intelligent, fairly weak in strength but strong
      in character.  Drev are exceptionally loyal, and fairly competant
      as fighters.  Drev enjoy helping others to be pleased with them,
      they enjoy praise, and are a bit naive about the ways of the world.

      Physical traits:
      Short with orange or tan skinned.
      Large bodies, small heads, they are substantially smaller than
      dwarves.
      A profuse amount of body hair, almost like fur, usually brown.
      Age quickly, living between 75 and 100 years.

      How to roleplay this race:
      Drev are, when very young, mentally underdeveloped.  They educate
      themselves at a later age, starting when they are twenty, due to
      the slow process of mental development.  Drev are little kids for
      nearly a fourth of their lives.  Before their mental skills begin
      to develop, however, Drev are extremely naive and easily fooled.
      At age 20 they begin to become cultured and begin to understand
      more complex topics.

      For the first 20 years of a Drev's life, their childhood is usually
      spent farming in the forests.  Drev's favor treehouses to ground-level
      homes, but prefer any residence to none.  They enjoy being personal
      assistants, loyal subjects (to their kings and leaders), and good
      companions.  They enjoy adventuring with others, preferable adventures
      which take them to exciting new lands and on wild dangerous voyages.  
      Drev dislike fighting, but are good hunters nonetheless.

      Drev are unique, not being closely related to any particular race.

      Drev are limited to a knowledge of 30 skills in their lifetime.
      Drev gain bonuses to strength and wisdom.
      Drev suffer penalties to dexterity and constitution.

- [Faces]

      This section describes the different people of the realms who have
      attained a sort of fame or fortune which is known throughout the
      Isles or on the mainland.  I have met or been in the presense of
      each of these people, so I have a fair degree of understanding of
      their affairs.
      
Author's Note:  Some of these are roles played by players of The Isles.
                If you wish to play a role that is currently not being
                played, please contact an admin.

 ---- Tradesmen
 
      Notable tradesmen are those who are the forebearers of their chosen
      field.

   -- Foerlin
   
      Who can one know better than oneself?  I've travelled a great deal
      and have collected or created a multitude of maps and traveling
      aids which I sell at my shop in Keveg, on Rygor Isle.  I've been
      in the trade for a great length of time, and I welcome you to stop
      by, buy a map or two, and say hello.  I keep copies of my Tome on
      hand at all times.

   -- Githryn

      Githryn is the head of the Gemmaster's council in Kyrinn, and is 
      the foremost gemmaster in the world to date.  I have met with him
      only once during my journey to Kyrinn.  I had an overly large
      assortment of unique gems which I wanted to sell him, and was
      granted audience.  He is a down-to-earth man despite his overwelming
      disposition and high authority whereever one may travel.  He has
      a modest tower in which he does most of his studies, and is always
      kind and hospitable toward travellers.  Quite a strange combination
      for being a mainlander for so long.  One would suspect he would
      have long ago resigned to bloodshed that is so the custom on
      Tyselorrd.   

   -- Ketra
   
      Ketra is the cheif mystic, who resides in a rather primitive
      nomadic tribe.  She teaches True Magick like no other, but finding
      her may be difficult.  She moves from town to town, area to area
      and place to place rather often.  If you do happen to find her
      at some point, mention that I sent you, and she'll give you a good
      meal and lodging.  Just don't be surprised when you wake up one
      morning to find that your tent is the only one left.

 ---- Merchants

      Many great merchants have arisen in recent years.  This is truly
      the Trader's Age.  The Consortium and the Dwarven Merchant's Guild,
      being the largest, have attained a great amount of fame throughout
      the known world.      

   -- Aidrus
   
      Aidrus the dwarven merchant is a good man to know if you ever
      travel to the Port of Cape Red.  Aside from his extravagantly
      constructed palace and his sometimes vile dealings with other
      merchants, Aidrus is a man of great respect and adoration. If he
      finds merit within a person, he will offer his fortune if not
      his life for such an individual.  Aidrus is appointed the new
      guildmaster of the Dwarven Merchant's Guild.

   -- Gaerbryn
   
      Gaerbryn is a merchantwoman of the Consortium who runs all foriegn
      and exotic stores.  She is truly a sight to behold.  Aside from
      her surpassing beauty and razor-sharp wit, she is a wonderful person
      to get to know.  She has a fondness for minstrels, and will show
      her greatest hospitality to them.  She keeps an inn in Cape Red
      aside from her merchant business, and her twin sister Taylin runs
      the establishment.  If you do happen to meet with Gaerbryn on
      unfriendly terms, however, I wouldn't stay in the Forged Sword
      without an armed escort and a death wish.

   -- Fochan Luri
   
      Among the more cutthroat businessmen of the Consortium, Fochan Luri
      owns and runs the Consortium with an iron hand.  My brief visit
      to his abode was not wholly unpleasant, but the man is truly as
      ingenius as he is infamous.  But, one must admit, House Luri's
      stores are always filled to the brim with the most quality and
      highest quantity of supplies, should one decide on a shopping spree
      in Cape Red.

 ---- Lords, Overlords and Kings
 
      Among the government officials of the Isles, and of Tyselorrd, there
      are some of note whose names you may encounter in your travels.

   -- Lord Luke Kthana
   
      A man of honor, Lord Kthana is a true and just ruler who lives by
      his word instead of his sword.  He has set up a republic system
      similar to Rygor, and agrees with his old friend Coranos Rygor
      on many things.  A long-standing unwritten alliance has formed
      between the kingdom of Kltara and that of the Serpantine Isle.
      Kthana is devoted first to his people and second to his wife,
      the lovely Lady Melinthra.

   -- Lady Melinthra
   
      Truly a lady beyond her times.  Her love for Kthana is true, but
      her beauty and intelligence woo the hearts of most men that meet
      her.  She runs the Serpantine Guard at Keep Kthana and is a master
      swordswoman. And, aside from her humble beginnings, she is one of the
      most noble and respectible women in the known world.   

   -- King Coranos Rygor
   
      A king who has been called 'King of the People' by his loyal subjects,
      King Coranos Rygor is the decendant of a long line of just and fair
      rulers.  His father, Itonus Rygor, and his mother, Miyath Rygor,
      were both well respected and loved by their subjects.  Unlike his
      father, however, Coranos is trying to give the people more power
      in government operations.  He has created a council system which
      is a partial effect on his rulings.  There is a court system which
      relies on the council to make all decisions.  Coranos has been called
      a gift from god by the farmers of the land, but nobles don't like
      him as much due to his love for his peoples.  I have visited with
      King Rygor many times, and I must say I do enjoy his company
      immensely.  He is one of the few leaders in this world that deserve
      the respect and admiration associated with his position.
   
   -- Imperator Tiktui

      As a mapmaker, it has never been my place to meet Her Most Highest,
      the Imperator.  Not that I would want to.  Tiktui has been forever
      in my mind's eye as a ruler who is up to no good.  Even though she
      has united most of Tyselorrd, her methods have not been peaceful,
      and the half-peace she has created on the mainland is not that
      of completeness and superiority.  She has moved her Imperial Seat
      to Kyrinn, a once lively city of knowledge, now cast as a city
      of careful words and unspoken ideas.  She is a dwarf, haughty,
      dangerous, whimsical.  Her repose is of careless evil and a vile
      demeanor.  I've never met the creature, only seen her, but I have
      nothing good to say for this bane of peace.   

 ---- Religious Figures

      Due to the secretive nature of most religions, and my lack of faith,
      I have little to say on these matters.  Nonetheless, there are many
      famous religious figures, gods, and living gods which one may find
      more about on your travels or in your studies.

      The Rygorian year is broken into 4 basic climes (winter, summer,
      spring and autumn) and 17 seasons, each consisting of roughly 30
      days.  The year ends during the season of the Freezing Spires and
      begins during the season of the Ice Cougar.  Most seasons are named
      after plants or animals or events of nature, except for the final
      season of the year, the Freezing Spires, which was borrowed from
      the original Tyselorrdian calendar.  A typical Tyselorrdian day
      lasts 24 hours, 11 hours typically occur between dawn and dusk.

- [The Tiktui Empire]

          The dwarven warlady, Tiktui, gained control of a massive force
      of barbaric, loyal and strong followers.  They reaped the countryside
      for a long time, pillaging, raping, conquering.  Then, still under
      the command of Tiktui, they changed their methods.  Instead of
      shattering the land, they sought to unite it.
          After years of conquest, Imperator Tiktui now controls a large
      majority of land on Tyselorrd.  She has a massive naval fleet of
      warships, thousands of soldiers, and her own Ungol Guard.  She
      has assassinated many kings, destroyed many cities and overthrown
      many governments in her long road to control.  Recently, she has
      moved her Imperial Seat to Kyrinn, the capital of the known world.
          She exercises military control over her subjects.  Her rule
      is that of an iron hand.  Her steadfast and oppressive techniques
      create an absolute control over her people.  Ungol guardsman
      are constantly involved in incidents with the citizens of her
      empire.  Stories are told far and wide of the death-filled dungeons
      and prisons.  She is a great contrast to the fair and just rule
      of the kings and lords of the Isles.
          Tiktui's main general, a human named Drinedar, is son of the
      ruler of the neighboring city-state Nostol.  His battles and
      conquests are one of the reasons of Tiktui's powerful reach.
      Her naval admiral is a Trioskenne named Kijev.
          Tiktui has recently employed an earthen gemmaster named Garvin
      who is known for his necromancing and earthen death magick.  Rumors
      abound of Tiktui's interest in creating an army of walking dead,
      but all reports remain unconfirmed.

- [Fiefdoms]
                                        
      Aside from the empire, many fiefdoms divide the land.  There are
      so many tribes, peoples and governments that one could not list
      them in such a general index as this tome, but I will list the most
      frequently encountered that pertain to your journeys in and about
      the Southern Isles of Jharl.

 ---- Haedar

      It was perhaps the first empire that Tyselorrd had ever seen.
      Since the dawn of the First Circle, never before had such a large
      area been united under one rule.  The barbarian warlords from the
      kingdom city-state of Nostol surged outward, screaming battlecries
      and their king's name, King Haedar the First!  Their conquests
      were known far and wide.  They pillaged the landscape, took the
      dungeons of far off castles, freeing the prisoners to fight
      amongst their ranks.  A group of kings drew their generals together,
      and the combined effort thrust the legions of Haedar back to
      Nostol.  Leaving the city in ruin, the barbarians were constrained
      to their dying capital.  In recent times, however, King Haedar the
      Twenty-Third has joined Tiktui and is fighting on her side, hoping
      to win an advantage over the peoples and once again bring glory
      to his country's name.  Nostol's kingdom, however, has yet to
      see results, for Haedar still controls only his city-state and its
      crumbling borders.
      
 ---- Rygor 

      The Sovreign realm of King Rygor, known to its people as Kltara,
      is perhaps the smallest kingdom to boast so many people.  While
      city-states like Nostol and great empires such as that of Tiktui
      contain massive areas of land, Rygor's realm contains almost
      as many people as Tiktui's empire.  It was late in the Second
      Circle that Rygor's grandfather fled to the Isles.  The leaders of
      Kyrinn had ousted the government and were working along with
      the Gemmaster's Council to overthrow what else remained.  Rygor's
      grandfather was involved in a conspiracy to put the Council into
      power without allowing the nobles who were helping them to get
      any rewards.  Rygor's grandfather's plan was discovered.  In a dual
      murder, Rygor's grandfather barely escaped with his life.  He fled in
      a fleet with his supporters to the Southern Isles of Jharl.  The
      islands were largely populated only with non-humans (elves,
      drev and buckawn) and a few dwarven tribes.  Rygor's grandfather 
      settled on the northern coast and soon his kingdom was born.
          When Rygor's father died, his mother became regent until Rygor
      was of age to take the throne.  On his eighteenth birthday, Rygor
      took his father's place in the noble hierarchy of Kess.  Kess,
      a still growing city, had expanded exponentially from the first
      arrival of settlers.  Once the harvests were yeilding surplus,
      trade started.  After this, the Andraius mines were discovered,
      along with the dwarves who had built it, and the population grew.
      The economy, now backed by silver, platinum and gold, boomed.
      By the time Coranos Rygor was to take the throne, Kess was three
      quarters of the way to being the size it is today.  In the last
      twenty-odd years since Coranos Rygor's rise to the throne, Kess
      has been gradually improved by Rygor's constant construction of
      new establishments.  The royal mint, the Lycaeum and several
      other North Bank structures all are the doing of Coranos Rygor
      and his generous attitude toward his people.  The kingdom,
      as well as the city, is flourishing under Coranos's rule.

 ---- Kthana
 
      Kthana's realm, or the Serpantine Isle, was a new order created
      when Luke Kthana was expelled from the Royal Guard of King Rygor,
      the elite warriors of Coranos's father.  Luke Kthana chose to
      start a new settlement in the south, building his keep with his
      inheritance.  His fiance (now wife) Melinthra helped to forge
      his unique order of knights, the Knights of Jharl.  The kingdom
      is now allied with Kltara in all respects, and the two kingdoms
      function together in many respects.

-----------------[    Part 4:  Economical Report    ]----------------------


- [Guild Breakdown]

      There are five guilds which control the major industries and
      trades.  Each is controlled by a seperate organization, though
      certain unlisted groups are partially owned by these five.  Of 
      course new guilds are always being formed and absorbed, but they
      are of little signfigance to these guilds.

 ---- Caravan Group
 
      The Caravan Group is a freeman's trading group.  Many independant
      trading groups have joined the Caravan Group for its added
      protection against the other antagonistic merchant consortiums.
      The Caravan Group sports several storehouses, a private dock in
      the Port of Cape Red and its own private guard.  The Caravan Group
      is run by an electorate council on their estate outside of Keveg,
      and requires dues from its members in the form of a profit
      percentage.
 
 ---- The Consortium
 
      The Consortium is a large merchant's association encompassing all of
      the known world from the most northern city on the mainland down
      to the sparcest islands that lay even more south than the Southern
      Isles of Jharl.  In the last few decades, the Consortium has set
      up an estate at the Port of Cape Red, opening up Rygor Isle to its
      dealings and it ways.  It is a highly competative organization,
      both intro- and extrovertedly.  A class-like heirarchy has been
      developed to keep order within the infrastructure.  
      
          Moddlets are the lowest ranking "officials" above the standard
      base class of merchants. Moddlets pool resources and create small
      "factions" of merchants serving the next higher class, Finnettes. 
      Finnettes, in turn, are large conglomerate heads, usually with
      elaborate homes (not estates) and large numbers of Moddlets working
      beneath them.  Finnettes can appoint Moddlets from the merchant class.
      The next class above Finnettes are Hivots.  Hivots, in turn, deal
      with the vast resources of the local Consortium warehouses, appoint
      and direct Finnettes, and maintain a modium of order and monetary
      organization.  Bawt are the highest local officials, maintaining
      and controlling the order of all the lower classes, and all local
      Consortium members.  Bawt appoint all local classes, including
      additional "partnerships" of Bawts.  Bawts answer only to Consortium
      Ambassadors from the Consortium Headquarters at an unknown location
      somewhere on the mainland.
      
      Local Consortium ranking from lowest to highest power:  Moddlets,
      Finnettes, Hivots, Bawts and Consortium Ambassadors.
      
      The Consortium concern themselves mainly with exporting local items
      and importing exotic foreign items.

 
 ---- Dwarven Merchants Guild
 

          The Dwarven Merchant's Guild was created by a group of dwarven
      foriegn businessmen from Kreighaad.  The dwarves wanted a merchandom
      which would provide a special sort of haven for dwarves who wished
      to transcend their mining and grunt-working heritage.  The Dwarven
      Merchants formed under the direction of the High Dwarf Caedrus of
      West Chireminster (he town over which Vesper has been built).
      Caedrus was a farm owner who had a love for poetry and money, and
      desired to seek out art it in all its forms to surround himself
      with.  Caedrus died in the year 373, and since then the two heirs,
      Kilvek and Tranfad ruled until their double-assassination in the
      year 452.  Since then, Aidrus of Cape Red has been appointed the
      guildmaster.
          There are three different levels of control in the Guild.  The
      highest seat is guildmaster, a single presiding judge who settles
      council desputes, regulates the Guild treasury, and appoints new
      council members and ambassadors.  The next highest, just below
      the guildmaster, are the council members who make up the majority
      of the owners in the Dwarven Merchants Guild.  Council members
      vote for changes in the Guild, are usually owners of businesses
      and such trading facilities.  However, since the DMG is based in
      the Port of Cape Red, Kessian merchants (and those from other
      towns and islands) appoint their own respective councils, but
      report all changes to the headquarters in Cape Red.  The lowest
      rung on the DMG ladder are the journeymen and merchants who work
      for council members and the guildmaster himself.
            
 
 ---- Zozzo
 
 
      The Zozzo are a group of mixed races who wander in a nomadic fashion
      across the isles selling goods they make along the journey, or
      acquire from other towns.  Zozzo is actually just a term meaning
      'wandering traders' . . . however, the largest group of Zozzo,
      from which the term derives, travels an extensive wilderness route
      between all points of civilization on Rygor Isle.  Zozzo members
      are all equal and each gains a position according to their acquired
      skills.  The cabinmaster, or caravan leader, is the only "leader"
      in the group.   Zozzo memberships are predominantly human and
      thilonenne merchants, but any race can be found among Zozzo ranks.
 
 
 ---- The Zylots
 

      The Zylots are trioskenne merchants from Zalufin who sell expensive
      luxury items to the other guilds.  They import artwork, exotic
      lotions and ointments, rare, high quality weapons, jewels, gems
      of extraordinary power, expensive spell components and other
      items of a higher value than the norm.  From vases to gold spheres
      of the most perfect formation, the Zylots are known to deal in
      only the most quality of items.  However, it is rumored the Zylots
      also deal in illegal goods and have extensive underground operations
      in Kess and Cape Red, selling more than just objects but information,
      poisons and other illegal goods.

 
- [Trading]

      Trade is the main form of capital in the Isles.  It is the economy
      of bartering which is the most successful form of monetary gain.
      Trading resources is a tiresome job, but one of great travel and
      great rewards.  The danger of the road, the excitement of the
      deal and the conditions by which your coinage has been sought
      are what makes a merchant what he is.  

 ---- Goods List    
 
      This is a list of goods which one can find in warehouse-type stores
      and supplies.  These goods are mostly foodstuffs, which tend to
      be a main source of income for merchants traveling to and from
      farming villages.  Spices, herbs, foods, jams, corns and sweets
      are items which no one person can do without.

 ---- Components (for spells)
 
      
      Should a magician be low on his stock of iron filings or acidic
      supplies, it is easy to discover where one can go to find such
      rarities.  Merchants who deal primarily in spell components and
      true magick supplies are imperative to those who practice such
      arts.  Many of the items on this are so rare that it is doubtful
      one could find the supply at a reasonable cost, and many times
      this is true.  While merchants in this field do not make bulk
      sales, the transactions that are made are costly and always
      seem to end up in the trader's favor.

      Basic materials are the lifeblood of the realm.  What good is a 
      tailor without cloth or a blacksmith without iron?  A silversmith's
      teaset is hard to produce without a bar of the purest metal, and
      the Royal Mint could not function without the gold and copper
      trade.  Listed here are furs, cloths and metals found and sold
      throughout the realm.

 ---- Industries
 

      Basic industries in the realm are the professions practiced by
      guilds, independant craftsmen and conglomerates.  The following
      is a loose compilation of possible occupations one could encounter
      in your travels.  By far this is not a complete list.  For those
      not familiar with all the terms mentioned, I've included a brief
      summary of each profession.
      
   -- Arts
       
      The artists of the realms range widely.  Painters using ox hair
      brushes and sap-oil paints, sculpters ranging from red clay
      to marble and obsidian, and bards playing instrument from
      asterflute to zither.  Not to mention the novelists and, ahem,
      other writers of our realm.

-------------------------[    Part 5:  Magick    ]-------------------------


- [Gem Magick]

      The oldests texts in the land have always included the use of gems
      for magick.  Scholars and gemmasters have puzzled over the years
      in the secret of why certain gems are bestowed with mystical powers
      while others are not.  In the traditional sense, all gems at one
      time had power, but through the use of eager young magicians, the
      mana dwindled from the land and less and less gems were produced.
      It is theorized that someday, no gems will hold value other than
      their luster and crystaline perfection.

- [True Magick]

      True magick is a more recently devised magickal art.  True magick
      involves the creation of magickal talismans by the mystical binding
      of certain properties in specialized mixing devices of magickal
      origin.  True Magick is not tied to any certain element, and is
      in cases more powerful, though requires careful preparation and
      expensive spell components.


-----------------[    Part 6:  Chronology (History)    ]-------------------


- [Ancient]

      These ancient texts were once preserved by the Great Monks of the
      Southern Shore, exumed from the ashes of the ruins along the shores
      of Nostol and near the site of present-day Kyrinn.  In fact, the
      city itself was named in memory of the Great Abbot, Kyrrinus.

 ---- Scribed Texts

      These texts were transferred from an older, now lost manuscript.
      They were no doubt copied and recopied over countless generations
      by the Great Monks.  Their teachings are old, and were at one
      point translated from an old tongue current unfound amongst one's
      travels in the world.  One can only guess at what the true meanings
      of the texts can be.

   -- The Yellowed Scrolls
   
      The Yellowed Scrolls are thusly named due to their layout.  Upon
      discovery, it was shown that the Yellowed Scrolls were endless
      reems of paper or papyrus.  Stained only with the tests of time,
      these scrolls were mainly historical and chronological accounts.
      They were found in vaults, deep beneath the Valley of the Ashes,
      near the volcanic rift valley on the mainland. 

            ------------[  The First Scroll  ]------------
            
      Yea one would come that should live and die within my teachings.
      The world is nothing but a stage of countless actors, acting their
      pointless plays upon the deaf ears of the audiences which behold them.
      One must not easily join the ranks of these cutthroats.  They hold
      kingdoms in their power, but yet possess no understandings more or
      less fragile than that of the old ones.  History must go forth to
      find it's own repeating circlets in time.  Time, the jester, finds
      us all the victim of a long, sick practical joke.
          The masters are gathering at the Great City.  They plan for more
      than just a conference this time; they plan for much more.  War is
      in their minds and deceit and murder lie like vipers in their hearts.
      Spiked with angled claws and fangs, they are lying in limbo: waiting.
      Their plans, like cobras, are poised to strike at the neck and suck
      from it the lifeblood of our families, replacing it only with the
      sickly venom which flows from their everlasting hatreds.  Who can
      forget the old ties?  No one seems to remember why they hate the
      ones they hate, but without cause people are labelled and forever
      they wear their masks.  An earthly facade of sharading fools.  Who
      will find the True Light within them?  Hardly but one stops for a
      moment to listen to the birds sing or the moths flutter from flower
      to flower.
