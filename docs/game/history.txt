          In the earliest reaches of modern history on and about
      the continent of Tyselorrd, there were three great periods of
      history.  These episodes were:  The Great Uniting and Exodus,
      The Rise of the Guild and the Wrath of Tiktui.  
      
         The Great Uniting (1-52)
         
      Out of the great midcontinental basin, to the northwest of
      the Ring of Fire on the mainland, three tribes vied for power
      amongst the masses of human civilization.  The most powerful
      of the tribal leaders was Vlattensintri, the great warrior
      king who conquered the northlands along the rivers Tallez and
      Fodbrok, and later settled areas encompassing much of the
      northlands.
          A team of colonists travel southward to explore and settle
      an area south of the Ring of Fire.  Seperate from the great
      empire is the town of Nostol, on the southern shores.
          In the midst of Vlattensintri's glorious reign, a rival
      tribe by bloodmark, called the Zengalli, arose from the basin
      to oppose Vlattensintri.  The Zengalli are weak and unable
      to greatly threaten Vlattensintri's stranglehold on his kingdom.
      The great citadel at Tallez remains in the hands of its creator,
      Vlattensintri.
          Vlattensintri weds Maesha and his heir, Vlan, is born.
      Maesha dies in childbirth.  Later, Vlattensintri takes his
      second wife, Vassentra, and to them are born two daughters, 
      Iret and Nemi.
      
         The Exodus (52-211)

          After Overlord Vlattensintri's death, Vlan seizes control
      of the kingdom.  Mismanagement and greed cause the greater
      downfall of Vlattensintri's reign.  In the end, Vlan is overthrown
      by his rival sisters efforts with a revolutionary group called
      the Pi'chek-Ur.  The Pi'chek-Ur dissolve into the armies of the
      coastal kingdom, the Iak-paro, longtime allies with Vlattensintri.
      In its weakened state, the empire wrought by Vlattensintri begins
      to crumble and is eventually conceded by the Zengalli.  At this
      time a great Crown is wrought by a mysterious race called the
      Alvak, a mysterious people who keep temples in the Ring of Fire.
      The favored sword of the dead King Vlattensintri is also reforged
      here at this time.  The Alvak, after seeing the uniting of the
      human tribes by the Zengalli, take the Crown and the Sword and
      disappear across the Watervoid.

          The Rise of the Guild (211-1109)

          The Iak-paro eventually fades with time and the Zengalli declare
      control of the northlands.  The Zengalli are a proud and noble
      race now-- their blood has mixed with the crafty Iak-paro and the
      valorous and hardy Vlattensintri.  They rediscover the southern
      city of Nostol and its neighboring dwarven city, Hransoerd.  This
      is the first real contact with dwarves.  Hransoerd is a great
      mining establishment south of the Ring of Fire that yeilds great
      ore supplies.  Great ties are founded between the Hransoerd dwarves
      and the people of Nostol, and thus these ties move to the Zengalli.
          The Hransoerd dwarves reveal a great cache of mysterious gems
      with strange inate properties.  The great philosopher, Kyrinnus,
      founds a small enclave to the west of Nostol called Kyrinn, dedicated
      to the study of the nature of these gems.  Upon his death his closest
      students formed a guild dedicated to the proper use of these elemental
      crystals, called the Welkyn, the Gemmaster's Guild.  Kyrinn's 
      population grew at an alarming rate.  It soon became larger than
      the northern cities and was a great southern seaport.
          A great age of exploration begins.  Many ships sail in all
      directions to discover what lies outward upon the oceans of Watervoid
      and the Great Ocean.  Many never return.  To the south, a great
      archipelago is discovered by the human explorer Jharl of Kyrinn.
      A few small settlements appear on the northern coast as refueling
      depots for southward-bound expeditions.  Eventually a great port on
      the southwestern side of the island, south of what is referred to as
      the Broken Coast, is established.  Due to the color of the sands along
      the cape which it flanks, the town is called the Port of Cape Red.
          The thilonenne are discovered inland on Rygor Isle, and later
      more are discovered to the south on the island of Mudak.  These
      thilonenne, strikingly similar to the Alvak, live in stone structures
      in the deep forests of Cape Red.  They coexist with a primitive
      tribal people called the drev.
          Southward further the fortress of Kreighaad is discovered and
      the Hransoerd dwarves rediscover their southern brothers. The heveti
      are discovered on the Serpentine Isle.  Ikthius Rygor flees the
      mainland and founds the town of Kess, despite the Guild's prodding.

          The Wrath of Tiktui (1110- )

          In Kyrinn, the Guild has discovered much of elemental magicks.
      Great warriors and greater gemmasters exist in the realm now, but
      little war is fought.  Gem-based necromancing, a dark study of earthen
      elemental magicks, involves the crafting of a sceptre of magickal
      properties called the Tethri rod.  It is a powerful item that
      amplifies the effects and power of different earthen gems when
      properly used.  The vile dwarven mistress, Tiktui, rises from her
      detriment in Hransoerd and steals the Tethri rod from her human
      master.  She wields its power to gain control of armies of undead
      and easily captures King Haedar of Nostol.  Eventually she is able
      to control Kyrinn and futher strengthen her empire through the
      manipulation of the members of the Gemmaster's Guild.  She calls
      upon great external forces to bend and distort the fields of battle.
      Her control of her armies is strengthened by the great tomes of
      the
