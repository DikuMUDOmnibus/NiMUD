     Notes on this Timeline

    Calenders throughout the realms on Tyselorrd have changed dramatically
    over the centuries.  In addition to the standard calenders of each age,
    many kingdoms had adopted their own timekeeping system.  For the
    modern reader, we have simplified the timeline as much as possible
    while still retaining the original dates of each individual kingdom
    or age which is the focus of that particular passage of the timeline.
    The number in the far left column contains the date in relation to the
    first entry in the timeline.  The number in the next column to its
    right is the local date, followed by the passage.

                                  the warrior Vlattensintri's grand citadel
                                  on the river Tyre in the northlands, along
                                  the coast of the great ocean called Moerd.

                                  Soudbrun.  Vlattensintri's yet unnamed
                                  citadel is stocked for the winter just in
