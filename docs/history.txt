ftp.game.org hosted packages
----------------------------

The following versions are hosted on ftp.game.org, by Derek 
"Thoric" Snyder. He and I have our disagreements about certain
aspects of MUD history and the origination of certain features,
but I will tell you this: ftp.game.org has been an outstanding
service and has been around a very long time.

NiM5.prerelease.src.tar.gz 
327k

A prerelease package of NiM5 around the time I had released a
package called NiMUD 5.1a; contains some of the features inherent
to the 5 series of releases.  These releases were attempts to
incorperate various external contributions to the software, which
I feel failed.  Some of the contributions made were less than
satisfactory and contained downright erroneous documentation.

TheIsles1.1.tar.gz

Second release (after 1.0), still a Merc/Diku derived mud

TheIsles15.code.tar.gz
199k

The third publically released version of 'The Isles' the original
server I worked on as a first-time mud administrator.  My favorite
code because of its reliability, a generally good mud server with
basic, fun features simple enough for any user.  With minor
text file modifications, TheIsles can import Diku areas.  There
are some key features of the game which retained old Merc glory.
I was 15, Surreal was turning 18.  We had been mudding for two
years.

Of note, this was the first publically released MUD source code
that provided ANSI color.  We're sorry to say, we regretted its
overuse in certain MUDs.  This came from our experience with Telegard
and Renegade BBS software.

I believe it was this version which was originally ported
to Envy by Jason Dinkel and has now become ILAB/OLC.

TheIsles16.code.tar.gz

With the release of 1.5, 1.6 diverged slightly from its original
release and contained some major fixes, and some new beasts.

I considered this a tweak of 1.5, and with more bugs it went over
poorly.  It was at this time that I began what became a six year
effort to overhaul this mudding's first 'Merc-derived' OLC-enabled
mud, and is the source of our Wikipedia entry which an anonymous
web author created.

A port to Win32 that ran locally only.  Ported by Lordrom
(oyehia@dsuper.net) and released in 1997.

nimud2000.tar.gz
462k

The year-2000 compliant release of NiMUD.  Also referred to as
the "Gold" release.  Fairly robust, but a primitive scripting
language with no magic system.

nimud4.tar.gz
859k

Another release made in 2000, with a significant number of
feature changes to warrant the release.  This is the version sent
to the Library of Congress and was granted US Copyrights.
