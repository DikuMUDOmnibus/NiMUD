Copyover has not been installed.  

Niksa omitted a step in its installation; also I have determined that it 
is not an important feature, as the startup script does this job for you.  
Though it is "nice" to hold the connections, its not exactly necessary.  
An avid player will come back after the reboot; the key is just to not
have too many reboots.

NiMUD's default reboot time is 1000 hours.
