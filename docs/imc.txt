NiM5 comes with IMC2 v4.24b hooks for installing IMC2.  Many modifications were made to the files imc.h,
imccfg.h and imc.c, but these modifications were in most cases surface; in an attempt
to decipher the convaluded IMC definitions, I realized this feature is mainly prepared
for SMAUG, though nimud variants are "claimed" to be supported.  I have installed this
version in the hopes that future versions will utilize the same RWHO protocol standards,
so I don't have to do this every time there is a new version of IMC.

However, due to complaints from its author, I have removed the files and
they are no longer available.  I do not have copies of these files, so
you will have to modify a newer version yourself.  I don't really 
recommend using IMC2.

If you want to update your version of NiM to include a newer version, follow instructions 
included in the newer version of IMC.
